So I'll, uh, pass it on to you, and you can start the lecture.sure. So thank you. Okay, so so the agenda for today's, uh so that we will be talking about the motivations for CNN like by just simple. Little networks won't do it on images or several other kinds of data. So why do we need CNN? First, we'll discuss that and then some history regarding what work has been done regarding CNN's andThen we will see the basic building blocks and different layers which people have came across. Uh, and we will then discuss the back propagation CNN as, uh, you must have done in a mist, uh, using the, uh, shallow neural. Introducing the mystery does it.And then we will finally discuss, uh, some common architecture. Is CNN architectures and some way to regularise them or improve their performance.Okay, so, uh, I believe that you are very familiar with Mr Asset, so it basically consists, uh, black and white images, which are 28 by 2018 size. So And they have one digit from 0 to 9 representing in that image.So basically, a simple MLP for, uh would require you to flatten this image. So you flatten it out into a 287, 84 dimensional victor one by 74uh, Dimension vector. And you just fit a simple multi layer perceptron into it and classify each input into one of the 10 classes.So this is the typical, uh, workflow for amnesty, and we are easily able to achieve 95 maybe 98% accuracy on the state of using very simple Uh, okay,So a typical output for for the last level look something like this. So this is a 10 dimensions input output. So this is the zero index, and this is the ninth index. So, uh, each the index. Basically, it tells you what is the budget on this image. So for this in 49 you can see the ninth, uh, value in this output. Uh, this is basically a probability distribution.So the ninth area has the ninth value. Sorry. The 10th value, The last value has the value of 0.99. So the model is very confident that this image contains the ninth.Similarly, for three, you can see the third index has, uh, like a perfect one probability for being three. And similarly, for two, you have this. So what I did was simply I just, uh,changed the input to the, uh, neural network, which was trained on this administrator. So I just shrink the images slightly and, uh, changed the position where the budgets were so earlier. It was just sent in central incentive, but now I am putting these digits on the sideways, and they are slightly smaller than earlier So what happened immediately was that the predictions were very messed up.So the model thinks that this budget is 012345. So the model think it's five, but it's actually zero. So you see that, uh, only with a slide shift of the image, the model's performance has reduced drastically. Similarly, for six, the model thinks it is 0123456.uh sure. Uh Yeah. So the model thinks 87. Okay, but, uh, So the key idea here is that the predictions got messed up similarly with one hair. So we would expect this to be the outfit of your model, but model was predicting this. So there is some error. So we need to make which is robust to these, uh, these kinds of variations,okay. So the key idea. So the key findings from about exercise for where that model does not generalise. Well, okay, so we need a model which have some degree of spatial invariance so we could have translation invariance.Okay, if we shift the digits slightly, the model's performance should not be, uh, affected drastically. So some amount of rotation should also be taken into account,right? And some amount of side invariants elimination invariants all these kinds of things should be taken into account. Okay, So I would just like you to just keep this in your mind. That what problem? Uh, what, uh, how would you solve this problem? What kind of architecture could you use?Okay.

And whenever they would show some stimulus, there would be some neurons that would get excited, and they recorded that electric impulse.So what they did was, uh, showed some edges, uh, to the cat, some edges of various orientation, somewhere moving so you could see this board. This man is flashing this boat in front of the cat's eyes and in turn, they are recording the impulse in the cat's brain.Okay, so this was the experiment done by them, uh, human and basil.

And I want you all to think that how would you use this information To modify the existing neural network, which you have trained and administrators, uh, so that it is more robust to spatial invariance. Like how we approach this problem? Just think for a moment.Okay, So the solution would be to just stand for digits. Okay, so let's say, uh, this isn't modified image image, so I have just shrink the zero and, uh, introduced some translation variance. So what I'm doing here is that I took a simple MLP.You can call it, uh, zero director for now. It only detects if, uh, zero is present in some part of image or not. Okay, so, uh, what I'm doing here is I'm taking small part of the image and then flattening it. Okay,so, uh, let's say it has, uh, 2020 some 400 pixels here. Okay, Le, let's assume that this is a small part of this entire image and then flattening it and then putting it into one MLP. Okay, then I'm scanning across all this, uh, this entire image and looking for occurrence of zero.So what is the output of this? MLP would be, uh, probability distribution between 0 to, uh 1 which says that if it has detected zero or not. So if it thinks that the image which was cast into this MLP contains a zero, it will have a very high probability, otherwise very low probability.Okay, so I'm just scanning this entire image, using my MLP who look for the zero. Okay. So once I have scanned the entire image. And if I see if at any place there was a high output from a model, then I would say, Okay, I have found a zero. So in this way. So this is the idea that by scanning, we can, uh, actually, uh, use some kind of, uh, introduce some kind of special robustness. So, uh, relevant of this, uh, space where? Irrelevant of location.In this image where the zero occurs by scanning, we are able to identify if it's present or not.

It's like 740. It's okay, but for seven, if we scan some part of seven and we could get one, right?Yeah, that's a valid problem. Uh, for that, uh, what we can do is we could we could add additional features. So that, uh, one so we can search for specific features, often digit digit. So let's say,uh, we could Instead of searching for the entire digit, we could search for some parts of it. So let's say if I have a feature like this, then maybe it's, uh indicates the presence of zero. Okay. And if I say that, Okay, there are four features which looks like this.

He's shifting that, uh, square box in this exampleby a certain amount. Right. So if you are shifting by a certain amount, you might get part of the digit. Uh, and in fact, the square maybe too small to include the full digits. Right. So these are all questions that should be in your mind right now. Uh, now, the whole idea here is that we don't have to have one layer of, uhuh, somebody who needs to mute here.

Sorry. Thank you. So, uh, mhm. So the idea here is that while scanning this entire image, the MLP is saying we are using the same MLB. We're not changing its weight, so this is very important.

Right. So you're just basically Sundays and put some activation function. Might be sick model any any kind of non linearity. So in this scanning approach, we are also doing the same thing. We're just taking a small part of the bigger image using, uh, those inputs, flattening them out, multiplying them with some weights and just putting some activation over it.Okay, so So this is an example where I am building the hierarchy. So as Selves are just explained that we are building hierarchy. So here you can see that output of this, uh, from this box. So the first box in this cream colour. So this output would go here in the next,uh, and output from this second box, which is shifted slightly. It would be just a decent road here. So by doing this, you're just building a compact representation of this image here.Okay, So this is one level of hierarchy. You could add another level. So you're just building over these hierarchies. So you're just learning some small features. And then, uh, on those small features, you're learning some more complex features using their combination.Okay, so you just, uh, scan. So these are the hair are different. New MLPs here. So this this MLP has, uh, one set of age. This is a new MLP. Here we are, scanning through it, okay. And then we have the final classification will happen. And so now we have sequentially added layers in one direction. We could also add, uh, complexity in the depth of it.So let's say you could have, uh, multiple different MLPs to scan on the first image itself. Earlier, I took an example of where MLP was detecting the zero.zero so you could have another MLP detects budget one another MLP for 32 for that kind of thing.

Let's just make sure that everybody is following this. Right. So, uh, guys, what? What do you think? Here are some of the hyper parameters.in what has been discussed up until now. What do you think are the hyper parameters? Remember, the hyper parametersare defined when we, uh, you know, kind of, uh, they're not the model parameters. The weights that are connecting one layer input layer into the next hidden layer we're talking about hyper parameters is the definition ofthe architecture and other parameters that define that architecture. Right? So, for example, in linear regressionwhere we are using, uh, you know, say some regularisation. The regularisation constant is a hyper parameter, and the step size is a hyper parameter, right? We're still going to use gradient descent to learn the weights,but we, uh are defining. Uh, you know, uh, some other aspects of the network, right? So clearly step sizes. One hyper parameter here in a multilayered perceptron. What are the hyper parameters? It's the number of hidden nodes.and the number of hidden layers, right? Those are important hyper parameters.

Right? So you're looking for all of these different types of features. So when we talk about philtres, another way of thinking of these philtres these philtres comes from image processing,right where humans used to handcraft these philtres to extract features like edges and so on. Think of them as features that are being extracted, right? And so what you're now saying is you're getting this smaller sized image, which is the compaction. And then, as government has drawn these lines across these, uh, compact representations you're saying There are different features that are extracted from the same set of small number of.all located pixels, right? So philtre is nothing other than an M by N box right that defines which philtres are which pixels are connected to each other.in that MLP. So earlier, the multi layer Perceptron be flattened out the whole image. Now we only flattening out a small piece, which is this m by N box, which we're calling peopleright?

Now we're actually using a very simple multi layer perceptron here.which is essentially just got an input and an output layer. The output layers out, putting, like you said,a non linear transformation of the weighted sum of the parts. But remember that we are looking for the same feature with this, uh, N box, right? And so as we scan across, we are not needing to change the way. It's because the weights define which feature we're extracting, whether it's a vertical line or a horizontal line at the simplest right, so we don't need to change the weights, and that's why we're doing we're sharing.okay. And then, similarly from the same set of pixels, we may want to have another feature extracted. So we are now got a new set of features and we're extracting that.

So we went from RGB Channel to another description of the same data which has a smaller X and Y axis as such of the image.

So to buy second by second element is this so I'm multiplying, uh, small a from the philtre with this matrix A herewith a element of these, uh, metrics. and similarly, I'm just looping over.

So this way, this time calculating the, uh, waited waited some hereand this will be a single output, which will be replaced here in my future map. Uh, so let's see if I have this. This is my G output. So in place of E here, I will have one single value, which will be the output of this entire operation.Uh, okay. So basically, uh, we are just representing what we have done till now in mathematical terms, because we are going to use this cross correlation and the idea behind it, Uh, mathematicallyfind expression for back propagation. Uh, is this clear? Yes, sir. okay? uh, So there are a few examples. Uh, this is the original image, and this is the philtre. So after, uh, sliding this philtre on the original image we get this is everything in This is the output of the free to map. This is the sharpen philtre. This is the blur philtre. And this is an edge detector.Okay, so now, uh, there's another term which is called convolution, so it is very similar to, uh cross cross correlation. But the key idea here is that while doing these calculations, your future map will be rotated by one or two degrees.Okay. Uh, so there is a visual example here, so So let's say this is your fault. The A B C D e f g h i and this is your input image.and you want to calculate, uh, the feature at some representation for on the output. So let's say you take, uh, this portion of your input image.three by three matrix. And you, uh, take the dot product with the element byproduct with these metrics. So you see here they will be, uh, multiplied with zero B also with zero except the ICT. Uh, I will get multiplied with one, so the output would be, uh and it will go in this place in the place of centre of these metrics, so in here.so in here, the central element will be I right. So if you do this for this entire image, you will see that your failure just got flipped by 180 degrees.okay. And to see a visual representation. So consider this. This has an image where all are all elements are zero. Only one has very one. And this is how your philtre looks like. So there is the black edge black pixel on this, uh, left top and white on this bottom. Right. And after performing this cross correlation, your philtre just got flipped. The white is now here on the above.Okay, so the idea behind conclusion is that if you just, uh, flip your philtre by 12 degrees and then blue cross correlation. Uh, then this term is called Coalition. So the basic idea is that we are going to use this cross correlation and conclusion to find the mathematical expressions for back propagation, so it will come hand in later.okay.

So what we're gonna do is we're gonna visualise these features for the religion. It Okay, Uh, so let me first explain that how these, uhhow these architectures look like. Okay, so, uh, the input here is, uh, before we go into the architecture, can we just, uh, do a little bit of discussion around how the philtre size impact, the output image size, But is that coming after this?Yes. I was just trying to bring Troy. I don't have, uh Okay. Okay. So let's say religion yet We use colour images, so let's say it will be a three dimensional image.And let's say it is 2. 56 by 2. 56 with three channels of input. Okay, so now we want to, uh, involved used 32 philtres here.Okay of dimensions, Uh, three by three. Okay, So this is how you generally defining your chaos or you're open source, uh, libraries, but under the hood. Uh, what is happening is that each philtre will have dimensionsthree by three. And this three, the depth is coming from the input. because the input image has three channels as death. So you're each philtre will also have a depth of three. Okay, so what we do here is that we take small, uh,crop of size three by three hair from this bigger image. three by three by three And we just, uh, do an element wise multiplication of all these elements in this cubewith this philtre. Okay, So if there are, let's say, uh, three numbers here and three numbers in the first, uh, slice. Then you just, uh, do the cross correlation, and there would be one output.Okay. And you do same for all the layers. So for second slice here also, okay, and output of this result would be single number.this is very important to note. Okay, so after conclusion where there will be one value here. So you do this for across entire this image. So you have access right of one.so let's let's leave it to them to come up with the answer. Okay, So with the stride of one pixel means that you're shifting by one pixel to the right all the way till you get to the end of the image, right?

For those of you who don't know about padding, just don't worry about it. Just tell us what is going to be the size of the image that comes out on the other side when we do the scanning. Now the stride works left to rightand talk to bottom. right. So as you scan across, you're going one pixel at a time and going to the next position where the philtre is applied. And then when you get to the end, you shift the philtre down by one,uh, pixel and apply it again. Correct? Yes, sir. Okay. So what is going to be the size of the image that is coming out on the other end? Or the the two dimensional array that's coming out at the end?

Okay, so what we're basically doing is we are just, uh, cross finding the cross correlation of each of this philtre with entire image. So as we, uh, looked earlier, uh, visual representation of cross correlation. So I just wanted to visualise that what these 32 philtres look like. Okay, SoI'm going to show you that how they look like, So I'm using really 16 for that. That's an architecture. It's a CNN architecture, very common.So it has taken, uh, RGB images of size 24 by 24. And so these are, uh this is the basic basic architecture. So it has to conclusion blockseach using 64 philtres. It then has a max full, then to conclusion blocks of 128. uh, philtres each again for school and then three conclusions by, uh, containing 2. 56 philtres and so on. You can see here and then we have a fully connected layer. Uh, the final layer, which classifies each imagine 2000 categories.This is the basic architecture of this video. 16. So, what we're trying to do here that in each conclusion lock so you can see there are 60 for future maps. We will just see how the 16th of future maps look like.So there are 1 28 ft high maps. We will look at each of them. Okay. So for the sake of convenience, I am only displaying features for these four or five players. The first, the very first conclusion there. The fourth player. 7, 1114. Okay, so let's just have a look at them.So this is, uh, first, uh, output of the conclusion block. Okay, so in what is this image of a house? Okay. And, uh, there are three, philtres of this dimension three by three by three.right. So after, uh, cross correlation of one philtre with the entire image, we get one feature map like this.Okay. For 60 for Philtres, 50 for such 60. For such philtres, we have 64 future maps, so you can see that each of the philtre is, uh,trying to highlight some specific features. So if you see here, this philtre is highlighting grass here.uh, this philtre here is highlighting the pillars. Or you could say the vertical edges. Okay. And, uhthis philtre here is highlighting the door so you can see each philtre is, uh, targeting some features.All right, so next I'm moving on to the fourth layer. So this was the layer of confusion blocks having 128 philtres.Okay, so I'm not showing all of the 128 philtres just because it gets very messy. So these are just 60 for philtres out of this 1. 28 here. So you can see, uh, compared from this is compared from the first congressional put, this one has become a little bit more detailed or abstract. You could say there is a lot more detail. There is a lot more textual information here.Some, uh, very dark. Some are highlighting several features. Okay, this is the fourth layer next, moving on to the seventh layer so you can see, uh, things are getting more abstract here. It's difficult to describe what features. Uh, CNN is learning,but we can see that something different is happening with each feature map. So there is a definition of house here, but in here, we have totally lost it. Maybe this this philtre would was looking for something else. which is not present in this feature in this image,maybe something like that. Okay, so now we have reached 11th layer. It has, I think, 2. 56 philtres and I'm displaying only 64 corresponding feature maps out of these two physics. Okay, No, things have become more abstract. And then, you know, 15th layer,uh, things become even more abstract. You could see that that some freedom maps are, uh, not saying anything at all.

Carry on group. Yeah. So this was the output of first conclusion block. 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th. And finally, we could use this output for classification. So basically, what we have done here is that we took an image and we extracted features out of that,and to some to that extent, that we are able to build a classified over it. That when we have an image of in house, we could say some features get activated if we have, uh, image of human that several different features get activated, and then we can use these activations to basically just classify or input dimension.Right.

The lecture concludes with a summary of the importance of these activations in classification tasks.'}], 'yellow_line': [{'Topic': 'Technical Setup', 'transcript': 'Can you try and share your screen?

So typically people think of CNN's for image and then ordinance foror recurrent neural networks for, um, you know, speech and and, uh, LP problems. But actually, CNN's are just as effective or, you know, have applications and architecture that have been based around CNN's for applications in speech as well as in, uh, NLP. So I'll, uh, pass it on to you, and you can start the lecture.sure. So thank you. Okay, so so the agenda for today's, uh so that we will be talking about the motivations for CNN like by just simple. Little networks won't do it on images or several other kinds of data. So why do we need CNN? First, we'll discuss that and then some history regarding what work has been done regarding CNN's andThen we will see the basic building blocks and different layers which people have came across. Uh, and we will then discuss the back propagation CNN as, uh, you must have done in a mist, uh, using the, uh, shallow neural. Introducing the mystery does it.And then we will finally discuss, uh, some common architecture. Is CNN architectures and some way to regularise them or improve their performance.Okay, so, uh, I believe that you are very familiar with Mr Asset, so it basically consists, uh, black and white images, which are 28 by 2018 size. So And they have one digit from 0 to 9 representing in that image.So basically, a simple MLP for, uh would require you to flatten this image. So you flatten it out into a 287, 84 dimensional victor one by 74uh, Dimension vector. And you just fit a simple multi layer perceptron into it and classify each input into one of the 10 classes.So this is the typical, uh, workflow for amnesty, and we are easily able to achieve 95 maybe 98% accuracy on the state of using very simple Uh, okay,So a typical output for for the last level look something like this. So this is a 10 dimensions input output. So this is the zero index, and this is the ninth index. So, uh, each the index. Basically, it tells you what is the budget on this image. So for this in 49 you can see the ninth, uh, value in this output. Uh, this is basically a probability distribution.So the ninth area has the ninth value. Sorry. The 10th value, The last value has the value of 0.99. So the model is very confident that this image contains the ninth.Similarly, for three, you can see the third index has, uh, like a perfect one probability for being three. And similarly, for two, you have this. So what I did was simply I just, uh,changed the input to the, uh, neural network, which was trained on this administrator. So I just shrink the images slightly and, uh, changed the position where the budgets were so earlier. It was just sent in central incentive, but now I am putting these digits on the sideways, and they are slightly smaller than earlier So what happened immediately was that the predictions were very messed up.So the model thinks that this budget is 012345. So the model think it's five, but it's actually zero. So you see that, uh, only with a slide shift of the image, the model's performance has reduced drastically. Similarly, for six, the model thinks it is 0123456.uh sure. Uh Yeah. So the model thinks 87. Okay, but, uh, So the key idea here is that the predictions got messed up similarly with one hair. So we would expect this to be the outfit of your model, but model was predicting this. So there is some error. So we need to make which is robust to these, uh, these kinds of variations,okay. So the key idea. So the key findings from about exercise for where that model does not generalise. Well, okay, so we need a model which have some degree of spatial invariance so we could have translation invariance.Okay, if we shift the digits slightly, the model's performance should not be, uh, affected drastically. So some amount of rotation should also be taken into account,right? And some amount of side invariants elimination invariants all these kinds of things should be taken into account. Okay, So I would just like you to just keep this in your mind. That what problem? Uh, what, uh, how would you solve this problem? What kind of architecture could you use?Okay. And the key idea is that by flattening the image, we lose the spatial information, which is very important. So we need to think some, uh, some other activity does not flatten the image", 'start_time': '00:04:11', 'end_time': '00:10:03'}, {'Topic': 'Spatial Invariance in CNNs', 'transcript': "Okay. So again, here is an example of dog from different, uh, angles. They're different sizes, different angles of the storey.so coming to some history of CNN's. So this problem has been quite well known. And since 1950 there's a lot of research going on. So one of the study done by Hubble and Weasel was, uh, they took a catand, uh, gave the card anaesthesia, so they forcefully kept the eyes opened up the card in the separatist, as you can see here.and they flashed a stimulus in front of cat's eyes. And in turn, they measure the electrical impulse generated in the brain in the brain of the cat. So they put electrodes in the brain. And whenever they would show some stimulus, there would be some neurons that would get excited, and they recorded that electric impulse.So what they did was, uh, showed some edges, uh, to the cat, some edges of various orientation, somewhere moving so you could see this board. This man is flashing this boat in front of the cat's eyes and in turn, they are recording the impulse in the cat's brain.Okay, so this was the experiment done by them, uh, human and basil. And the key findings were that, uh, there are some cells which get activated, uh, by some small edges or moving edges.Okay. And some cells are often direction specific. They only get excited when some edges being shown to them, Huh? Which is sliding from a particular direction onlyand, uh, there are higher higher level of cells, uh, more complex cells, which are selected with the length of the moving edge. So these kinds of these features simply build up over each other. So this was the key findings from the experiment.Okay, So that, uh, without losing the spatial invariance, how could we without flattening them? And how could we use that? So they figured out that somehow you need to build some hierarchy into the model to preserve the spatial information.", 'start_time': '00:10:06', 'end_time': '00:12:27'}, {'Topic': 'Historical Context of CNNs', 'transcript': "Okay, So these experiments basically set the stage for, uh, some outstanding research for the next 20 years and building on these ideas in 1986.

It was an unsurprised, uh, machine learning based architecture, which used to which was used to, uh, recognise digits.And it was the state of the art at its time. But some people said that due to, uh, computational limitations, they were not able to take it to the next close. Okay. And in the 19 nineties, building on these ideas, uh, so he was able to create first successful, uh, conclusion neural network. And it was called Lane at five.

And I want you all to think that how would you use this information To modify the existing neural network, which you have trained and administrators, uh, so that it is more robust to spatial invariance. Like how we approach this problem? Just think for a moment.Okay, So the solution would be to just stand for digits. Okay, so let's say, uh, this isn't modified image image, so I have just shrink the zero and, uh, introduced some translation variance. So what I'm doing here is that I took a simple MLP.You can call it, uh, zero director for now. It only detects if, uh, zero is present in some part of image or not. Okay, so, uh, what I'm doing here is I'm taking small part of the image and then flattening it. Okay,so, uh, let's say it has, uh, 2020 some 400 pixels here. Okay, Le, let's assume that this is a small part of this entire image and then flattening it and then putting it into one MLP. Okay, then I'm scanning across all this, uh, this entire image and looking for occurrence of zero.So what is the output of this? MLP would be, uh, probability distribution between 0 to, uh 1 which says that if it has detected zero or not. So if it thinks that the image which was cast into this MLP contains a zero, it will have a very high probability, otherwise very low probability.Okay, so I'm just scanning this entire image, using my MLP who look for the zero. Okay. So once I have scanned the entire image. And if I see if at any place there was a high output from a model, then I would say, Okay, I have found a zero. So in this way. So this is the idea that by scanning, we can, uh, actually, uh, use some kind of, uh, introduce some kind of special robustness. So, uh, relevant of this, uh, space where? Irrelevant of location.In this image where the zero occurs by scanning, we are able to identify if it's present or not. Okay, so this was a key idea that so we will just take, uh, this idea forward and modified, and, uh, let's see how growth. So", 'start_time': '00:13:37', 'end_time': '00:16:22'}, {'Topic': 'Model Predictions and Generalization', 'transcript': "one question there, uh, you were showing this. Oh, is that a kind of an or gate or kind of order of the outputs from here? What is, uh,yes? So basically, uh, I'm saying the highest of the highest for all these. Let's say this is, uh, the probability of finding a 00.10 0.01 and sometimes they'd say, Okay, I have very high probability of occurrence of zero. So I take the maximum of all these and then say Okay,I have found So zero Harris means means that I have found that the zero. Okay, so that's confusing. That, uhthat's good. So it was probably in the mind of the students, so I just thought I'd cheque. So it's a maximum that you're taking That takes the maximum. Yes.So this is where we have? Yeah, Yeah, for me. It's like 740. It's okay, but for seven, if we scan some part of seven and we could get one, right?Yeah, that's a valid problem. Uh, for that, uh, what we can do is we could we could add additional features. So that, uh, one so we can search for specific features, often digit digit. So let's say,uh, we could Instead of searching for the entire digit, we could search for some parts of it. So let's say if I have a feature like this, then maybe it's, uh indicates the presence of zero. Okay. And if I say that, Okay, there are four features which looks like this. They are coming in an image, so I can say, Okay, these are very close to zero, so you can just break that down into small features instead of taking into account the entire dignity.", 'start_time': '00:16:22', 'end_time': '00:18:08'}, {'Topic': 'Feature Extraction and Hierarchical Learning', 'transcript': "So what we're doing is we're hierarchically building this storey. So even another question that you should be asking at this point is that, uh, has chosen a box size that stores all of zero in it. Right? So also, he's shifting the scan that's taking place. He's shifting that, uh, square box in this exampleby a certain amount. Right. So if you are shifting by a certain amount, you might get part of the digit. Uh, and in fact, the square maybe too small to include the full digits. Right. So these are all questions that should be in your mind right now. Uh, now, the whole idea here is that we don't have to have one layer of, uhuh, somebody who needs to mute here. Uh, okay, So the idea here is that what has shown as a set of multi layer perceptron that are working on a small set of pixels in the neighbourhood,those are then being built upon by a second layer right, which is incorporating what are the features that have been seen in the previous player? So you're stacking up these features one on top of the other that are all essentially learning partial features to start with, and then more complete features, which then finally can lead to your classification. Does that make sense? The person who asked the questionwho asked the question. Yes. Okay, so this is just building on on what you know right now, which is a multi level perception, right?Yeah, go on. Sorry. Thank you. So, uh, mhm. So the idea here is that while scanning this entire image, the MLP is saying we are using the same MLB. We're not changing its weight, so this is very important. So this is called wait sharing him here. So we are sharing the weights. We're not introducing new weights at every, uh, box here,so which helps in reducing the A total number of parameters. We will study this, uh, detailing for the slides.", 'start_time': '00:18:09', 'end_time': '00:20:39'}, {'Topic': 'Hyperparameters in CNNs', 'transcript': "So the key idea is that any any layer in MLP there's only one thing which is taking the weighted sum of inputs and applying a non linearity. So you must have you must be very familiar with this, uh, expression that output off any layer is basically a weighted sum of, uhuh, inputs to the input stood from previous layer and the weight. Right. So you're just basically Sundays and put some activation function. Might be sick model any any kind of non linearity. So in this scanning approach, we are also doing the same thing. We're just taking a small part of the bigger image using, uh, those inputs, flattening them out, multiplying them with some weights and just putting some activation over it.Okay, so So this is an example where I am building the hierarchy. So as Selves are just explained that we are building hierarchy. So here you can see that output of this, uh, from this box. So the first box in this cream colour. So this output would go here in the next,uh, and output from this second box, which is shifted slightly. It would be just a decent road here. So by doing this, you're just building a compact representation of this image here.Okay, So this is one level of hierarchy. You could add another level. So you're just building over these hierarchies. So you're just learning some small features. And then, uh, on those small features, you're learning some more complex features using their combination.Okay, so you just, uh, scan. So these are the hair are different. New MLPs here. So this this MLP has, uh, one set of age. This is a new MLP. Here we are, scanning through it, okay. And then we have the final classification will happen. And so now we have sequentially added layers in one direction. We could also add, uh, complexity in the depth of it.So let's say you could have, uh, multiple different MLPs to scan on the first image itself. Earlier, I took an example of where MLP was detecting the zero.zero so you could have another MLP detects budget one another MLP for 32 for that kind of thing. And then you just basically build upon their features as well. So there is one head on. So you think. Think of this as a cube.right. And so, finally, you just can't get it. All of the features and you have a final classification.So this is how the idea of hair are key is taken into account from that horrible and visual experiment that we just build upon small features of the offer input and use those to classify, uh, actual image.Okay, so that's that's great. Let's just make sure that everybody is following this. Right. So, uh, guys, what? What do you think? Here are some of the hyper parameters.in what has been discussed up until now. What do you think are the hyper parameters? Remember, the hyper parametersare defined when we, uh, you know, kind of, uh, they're not the model parameters. The weights that are connecting one layer input layer into the next hidden layer we're talking about hyper parameters is the definition ofthe architecture and other parameters that define that architecture. Right? So, for example, in linear regressionwhere we are using, uh, you know, say some regularisation. The regularisation constant is a hyper parameter, and the step size is a hyper parameter, right? We're still going to use gradient descent to learn the weights,but we, uh are defining. Uh, you know, uh, some other aspects of the network, right? So clearly step sizes. One hyper parameter here in a multilayered perceptron. What are the hyper parameters? It's the number of hidden nodes.and the number of hidden layers, right? Those are important hyper parameters. So what do you think are the hyper parameters here?maybe the ship. The shift. Science. Okay, so one of them is the shift size. That's good. what else? sorry.Philtre sides. So by philtre you're referring to the size of the square that we are shifting. Right, So good. Okay.What else? Number of philtres. Number of Philtres, Okay. a number of hidden layers.

What is this,", 'start_time': '00:20:40', 'end_time': '00:26:04'}, {'Topic': 'Filter Operations and Image Processing', 'transcript': "uh, diagram showing you each of these layers that you're seeing here? Uh, you know, so that we've got this image, the input image,right? And from each of the input images where we are creating one of these blue, uh, kind of compact representations, each of those blue compact representations aredifferent Philtres, right? So, as as government said in in one set of Philtres, you may be looking for horizontal lines in others, you may be looking at vertical lines, others you might be looking at, you know, uh,lines that are, in some way curved. Right? So you're looking for all of these different types of features. So when we talk about philtres, another way of thinking of these philtres these philtres comes from image processing,right where humans used to handcraft these philtres to extract features like edges and so on. Think of them as features that are being extracted, right? And so what you're now saying is you're getting this smaller sized image, which is the compaction. And then, as government has drawn these lines across these, uh, compact representations you're saying There are different features that are extracted from the same set of small number of.all located pixels, right? So philtre is nothing other than an M by N box right that defines which philtres are which pixels are connected to each other.in that MLP. So earlier, the multi layer Perceptron be flattened out the whole image. Now we only flattening out a small piece, which is this m by N box, which we're calling peopleright? And that's getting flattened and it can have a multilayered perceptron that finally gives an output. Now we're actually using a very simple multi layer perceptron here.which is essentially just got an input and an output layer. The output layers out, putting, like you said,a non linear transformation of the weighted sum of the parts. But remember that we are looking for the same feature with this, uh, N box, right? And so as we scan across, we are not needing to change the way. It's because the weights define which feature we're extracting, whether it's a vertical line or a horizontal line at the simplest right, so we don't need to change the weights, and that's why we're doing we're sharing.okay. And then, similarly from the same set of pixels, we may want to have another feature extracted. So we are now got a new set of features and we're extracting that. The other thing to remember is right now is only talking about black and white image grayscale image.If we had a colour image, then we would actually the spirit er would not be an M by N. box. It would actually be a three dimensional box right where the third dimension", 'start_time': '00:26:05', 'end_time': '00:29:37'}, {'Topic': 'Pooling and Downsampling Techniques', 'transcript': "is three.

You are reducing the size of the image by doing the scanningright. And with every feature that you're creating is like another channel. Right? So we went from RGB Channel to another description of the same data which has a smaller X and Y axis as such of the image. But it has a depth to it, which is the number of features that have been extracted. Right. And this is a very common feature that you will see when you book shows you the more complicated structures of a CNN.You'll find that you start off with a large image with three channels and you end up with very small images, but with lots of features, lots of channels with it.Right. So this is a very, very important thing to remember when you're doing CNN's, because later on, you will see some very interesting uses of the same philtre to reduce dimensionality.Okay, so do you understand all of these concepts? the shift size. you can see that the boxes are overlapping over each other, right? And so you can have a shiftof one pixel or two pixels or whatever. So that becomes a hyper parameter. Like you said, the philtre size definitely the size of the box, the number of philtres at each layer that you're definingright, and the number of such hidden layers that are transforming the input into a smaller, more compact representation.Right is another type of parameters. So very good. And what is the shift called? What is the technical term for shift?stride. Okay, great. Excellent. Okay. Good luck. Any questions on this before it goes on? Because things will only get more complex as we go on.Okay, Wonderful. Okay, So this is the example of, uh, typical Syrian architecture. This is called the Leonard five, which was developed by young liquid.Okay, so here we can see that, uh, this is, uh, example of the box. We were talking earlier. And by scanning this, uh, moving this box across this image. So we end up with several feature maps, you can see.So let's, uh let's start moving towards, uh, terminology. So these are called the future maps here. Okay. And so let's say we have six philtres of such types. This is one philtre, so if you have six philtresThen you will have six feature maps for each philtre because one feature because one philtre will scan the entire image.So we'll have one future map similarly for six philtre six philtres. You have six feature maps. Okay. And then there is a layer called sub sampling. So where you just, uh, take the max? Uh, just sample down. So, uh, one of the most common, uh, sub sampling technique is called Max pooling. So what they do here is they take two by two, sample out of this feature map and say this has value one. This is 263, and this is forso they take the maximum out of it and say so. This, uh, two by two matrix has four as the maximum value. So for the next, uh, through the next feature map, the four will be representing one pixel here instead of four pixels.Okay, So this is basically how we sub samples. So we are just if it has 2828 dimensions, then the output will have 14 by 14 dimensions by using this, uh, two by two Max schooling.", 'start_time': '00:29:37', 'end_time': '00:34:08'}, {'Topic': 'Understanding CNN Feature Maps', 'transcript': "Okay, so this is called sub sampling, and then we have another conclusion.

They will pretend for any other data. There would be different number of classes Where, uh, where we want to classify our input image to be.uh, is this clear? So we will understand all these terms, uh, in the next slaves. So this is the typical architecture. So every architecture of the CNN has some, uh, modification of it,okay. When you are saying that there are six feature maps, you're basically talking about the third dimension, which is the under six channelsthat are being created. Yes. So here. You could say this is a volume which have six dimensions. Six depth. 28 is the time. 20 at theheight. And are you going to walk through how they get from 32 by 32 28 20 years? Yes. Okay. Thank you.okay? Okay, So there was one thing I want to visualise here. Yeah, so? So this is a typical grayscale image. So this is the original image you can see here. And this is just a zoom in version, so you can see that every pixel has a value from 0 to 2. 56 to 55. Sorry.So you can see, uh, the white pixel here it has value of 2. 55. Is the number eligible on the left hand side?okay. And for a black pixel, let's say, down here, the value is, uh, close to zero. Okay, so, uh, this is the representation of grayscale image, soSo now I just wanted to visualise that how this future would work. So here we have. uh, let's on the left hand side. You have this, uh, three by three matrix. Right? So what we're doing here is just, uh here in the centre, you have a philtre by three by three philtre So the it's called sharpen philtre. And it has, uh, these values. So what we are doing here is that just taking the value for each box in this red metricsand just doing an element wise multiplication with this, uh, sharp and philtre. And the output is represented here in the right hand side. So, for example,uh, let's take something near the so you can see here. Uh, the left, the left, and the first element in this, uh,read matrix is 103. You can see it here. right. So you're multiplying it with zero and then 128 with minus one and so on and so forth. And the output of this entire operation is just a single value, which is minus 157. You can see it in the middle, and this is represented here.uh, one pixel value in the right image. Okay, so this is basically the process of applying any philtre here.So, uh, we've got an answer. Which is minus 157. Yes. Uh, be clipped to zero. It will be close to zero.okay. And so you can see here that while working with the edges here so there won't be three values available.Right? So that's why the right image is padded with black border. That's all zeros it contains okay? So, uh, the key idea here is that these features these these philtres basically give rise to different feature maps. So this, this is called sharp and philtre.There is another thing called blur Philtre. So what does this basically takes the, uh, centre value of, uh, this red metricsand just adds, uh, surrounding pixel values basically smooth out the entire image so you can see that, uh, the multiplication happening and the images looks a bit blurry or, you could say, smoothed out image.Okay. So the idea to understand here is that we can have different types of these features. Sorry. Philtres there is called right, Sobel.So you can say it's kind. It's, uh, edges. It will. This is the right Sobel philtre. You can see the values are changing. So there is a left Sobel which detects different orientation of hedges. There is, uh,top Sobel, which identifies different orientations of the edges. So basically, everything is dependent on this philtre.

If I apply right Sobel, it detects vertical edges so on and so forth.is this clear? Yes, sir. Okay. so these weights are okay, So, uh, which no one is asking a question here. Uh, how? Well, normalising the pixel values affect the neural network.Um, so we should make sure you don't send it privately because those questions come to me, Uh, is not able to see it, but I've explained this, right? So when you talk about normalising the pixel values, what are you referring to? What you're talking about theapplication of these philtres. a new a new mutants piece. so, like dividing each pixel value by 2. 55.Okay, so that is really bringing the scale down to become from 0 to 1, right? Is that what you're? Okay, So what you're saying is, how does the normalisation of pixel values affect the neural network?a good book. Do you want to take this socialite? Uh, so please go ahead. Okay. So essentially, visual, what happens with the neural network when your input layer, uh, is essentially got very differing skills, right for each of the teachers. Then what is happening to the cost function that you're trying to minimise this that is stretched in certain directions and squeezed in other directions.Right. So whenever you actually calculate the gradient, you start kind of bouncing between points and don't move necessarily in the direction that gives you the, uh, which leads you directly to the ideal, uh, solution. Right? So what happens when you scale or normalise the numbers, All of the skills of all of the inputs? What ends up happening is that you get a much more rounder shift,uh, cost function, and so you will actually start to now the first known more directly towards the minimum,so it speeds up the minimisation of the past. That's the advantage of doing this normalisation okay? right. Anybody else have any questions around the application of the philtres themselves?are you making the Connexion between the fact that these philtres that are being played with up here, the colonel's as they're being referred to here, are essentially handcrafted Wales. Right? So you only have seven or eight philtres here.that are shown where the minus 101 minus 20 to minus 101 is one set of weights that have been handcrafted.Now, if you think about what a multilayered Perceptron is doing, it's actually learning these. It's learning these weights,right? So rather than us having to humanly created this, um, these philtres that we then know what kind of feature is going to be extracted by them by each application of the philtre throughout the image. What we are saying is we can actually now with neural networks, learn the weights, which will extract features that humans may not be able to interpret.but the neural network finds them useful. because they have been able to minimise the cost function as it is.does that make sense? so we are automatically extracting features that humans may not understand. right through each of these applications. Where the waves that you're seeing here, the minus 101 minus zero minus 101 are waves that are being set by the neural network automatically.right. And so we are learning these philtres. We have an infinite number of philtres we can learn here.", 'start_time': '00:39:56', 'end_time': '00:44:43'}, {'Topic': 'Convolution vs Cross-Correlation', 'transcript': "that are each tuned to the final result of what we are trying to achieve.

No. Okay, carry on. listen. So, uh, this thing which we just discussed is called coalition or a sliding dot org in mathematical terms, uh, to represent it. Uh, we can,uh okay. So this is your H metrics. You can call it the photo. and this capital F is your image. Okay.Uh, so let's say for, uh, I'll take an example of this portion of this image. I'm just, uh, mathematically describing what we have just discussed. Okay,so here we are going from minus Kate. Okay, for let's say, let's say this philtre will have zero in the centre zeroth index.instead of beginning from any side, we begin from the centre. So this has, uh, zero comma zero. Uh, Index, this has, uh,minus one comma one. I could have minus one for my one. This is my new school, Uh this is minus one common minus one just to be clear.And this is, uh, one comma one. And this is one common minus one. So basically, we are saying that the loop power fromminus 1 to 1 in case of a three dimensional feature or philtre so for, Let's say. four g three or three. So Okay,the left corner will be minus 11. the corner with bottom, Yeah. mhm. uh, one here because we are going from, uh, which is, uh,so So, uh, this is the X one. And this is why? right. So, uh, but the other way around. Right. So why is pointing downwards?Yeah. So the coordinator, there will be a minus 11, left bottom. X is minus right the X coordinate ofminus one. uh this should be minus 11. okay, so Okay, So, uh, idea here is So let's say we have this original image, and we want to, uh, slide this fritter across this entire image. And I want to have an output G, which is my feature map. You could sayokay. So what I'm gonna do here is, um So starting with U N. Vehicle to minus one here in this submission,you equal to minus one and equal to minus one. So I will take the minus one minus 11 element of this, uh, this edge metrics, which is the A.Okay. And, uh, I plus Youth Index. So I am calculating for G three of three. So this is +0123 and again. 0123. So this is my G three comma three.Okay. So if I take, uh, take this philtre and, uh, make the cost cross correlation, I will have a single value, which will be substituted in the place of E here.", 'start_time': '00:44:44', 'end_time': '00:49:36'}, {'Topic': 'Mathematical Representation of CNNs', 'transcript': "Right. So what I'm looking here is that, uh, eyes here three and us minus one. And Jay is also three.This is the icon DJ and J minus one. So I'm looking at second element here. So for her 01 to zero. we want. So to buy second by second element is this so I'm multiplying, uh, small a from the philtre with this matrix A herewith a element of these, uh, metrics. and similarly, I'm just looping over. So being small capital B plus small capital C includes. So this way, this time calculating the, uh, waited waited some hereand this will be a single output, which will be replaced here in my future map. Uh, so let's see if I have this. This is my G output. So in place of E here, I will have one single value, which will be the output of this entire operation.Uh, okay. So basically, uh, we are just representing what we have done till now in mathematical terms, because we are going to use this cross correlation and the idea behind it, Uh, mathematicallyfind expression for back propagation. Uh, is this clear? Yes, sir. okay? uh, So there are a few examples. Uh, this is the original image, and this is the philtre. So after, uh, sliding this philtre on the original image we get this is everything in This is the output of the free to map. This is the sharpen philtre. This is the blur philtre. And this is an edge detector.Okay, so now, uh, there's another term which is called convolution, so it is very similar to, uh cross cross correlation. But the key idea here is that while doing these calculations, your future map will be rotated by one or two degrees.Okay. Uh, so there is a visual example here, so So let's say this is your fault. The A B C D e f g h i and this is your input image.and you want to calculate, uh, the feature at some representation for on the output. So let's say you take, uh, this portion of your input image.three by three matrix. And you, uh, take the dot product with the element byproduct with these metrics. So you see here they will be, uh, multiplied with zero B also with zero except the ICT. Uh, I will get multiplied with one, so the output would be, uh and it will go in this place in the place of centre of these metrics, so in here.so in here, the central element will be I right. So if you do this for this entire image, you will see that your failure just got flipped by 180 degrees.okay. And to see a visual representation. So consider this. This has an image where all are all elements are zero. Only one has very one. And this is how your philtre looks like. So there is the black edge black pixel on this, uh, left top and white on this bottom. Right. And after performing this cross correlation, your philtre just got flipped. The white is now here on the above.Okay, so the idea behind conclusion is that if you just, uh, flip your philtre by 12 degrees and then blue cross correlation. Uh, then this term is called Coalition. So the basic idea is that we are going to use this cross correlation and conclusion to find the mathematical expressions for back propagation, so it will come hand in later.okay. It's important to recognise that what is actually happening in the forward fast is actually cross correlation. It's not convolution. Most people cannot get confused and think that that's the convolution operation. Mathematically, you're actually doing a cross correlation.", 'start_time': '00:49:37', 'end_time': '00:54:34'}, {'Topic': 'CNN Architecture Examples', 'transcript': "Yes. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So, uh, mathematically. So we saw that in cross correlation. We are going to, uh, multiply in this direction. So if we have a free to called a B c e f g h i j So we will multiply it with There is no image in this direction.Okay, we'll begin from the top left and move towards the bottom. Right. But in the case of convolution, uh, we move from bottomto the top. Okay. So because the future has rotated and just changing the sign here, uh, will assist in that happening, soOkay, Uh, you can just explore this on your own later on. If you just try to write these expressions down and you will be able to figure out that we're just recreating the philtreand doing the cross correlation, okay? Okay, so So till now we discuss these handcrafted philtres like the blur sharpen, agitation, etcetera. But these are the things which the model learns as just described. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna visualise these features for the religion. It Okay, Uh, so let me first explain that how these, uhhow these architectures look like. Okay, so, uh, the input here is, uh, before we go into the architecture, can we just, uh, do a little bit of discussion around how the philtre size impact, the output image size, But is that coming after this?Yes. I was just trying to bring Troy. I don't have, uh Okay. Okay. So let's say religion yet We use colour images, so let's say it will be a three dimensional image.And let's say it is 2. 56 by 2. 56 with three channels of input. Okay, so now we want to, uh, involved used 32 philtres here.Okay of dimensions, Uh, three by three. Okay, So this is how you generally defining your chaos or you're open source, uh, libraries, but under the hood. Uh, what is happening is that each philtre will have dimensionsthree by three. And this three, the depth is coming from the input. because the input image has three channels as death. So you're each philtre will also have a depth of three. Okay, so what we do here is that we take small, uh,crop of size three by three hair from this bigger image. three by three by three And we just, uh, do an element wise multiplication of all these elements in this cubewith this philtre. Okay, So if there are, let's say, uh, three numbers here and three numbers in the first, uh, slice. Then you just, uh, do the cross correlation, and there would be one output.Okay. And you do same for all the layers. So for second slice here also, okay, and output of this result would be single number.this is very important to note. Okay, so after conclusion where there will be one value here. So you do this for across entire this image. So you have access right of one.so let's let's leave it to them to come up with the answer. Okay, So with the stride of one pixel means that you're shifting by one pixel to the right all the way till you get to the end of the image, right? So recognise that you get to the end of the image when the right side of your philtre reaches the edge. Okay, so there's no paddingfor those of you know what padding is. There's no padding. For those of you who don't know about padding, just don't worry about it. Just tell us what is going to be the size of the image that comes out on the other side when we do the scanning. Now the stride works left to rightand talk to bottom. right. So as you scan across, you're going one pixel at a time and going to the next position where the philtre is applied. And then when you get to the end, you shift the philtre down by one,uh, pixel and apply it again. Correct? Yes, sir. Okay. So what is going to be the size of the image that is coming out on the other end? Or the the two dimensional array that's coming out at the end? Because remember what is sayingthat the three by three by three is producing only one number, so the multilayered Perceptron is taking27 inputs and is out putting one value.

So one person said to 54.And what was the other person saying? I think, uh, zero comma zero is concerned at the centre, and, uh, the other things are taken at that size in the same way you look at work,right? So, like I said, the we are resuming zero padding go padding right now. Right? So your philtre starts from the edge and takes the first three into account.right, and then it moves by one and moves by one. Right? So the size is going to be there. One answer that's been given us 254.Is that the number of rows or the number of columns, or what is to 54? I think both. Okay, Anybody else have a different answer?no sort of 54 and 54 in total Tito. in 2. 32. Okay, 32 because we've got 32 philtres. Good. Okay. I have been looking for one philtre with Excellent. Okay, so 254 by 2. 50 for 5. 32 will be the third dimension.Uh, just for this philtre Yes, output will be just a matrix. Uh, considering for just one philtre, this is just one,Uh, that's correct that we will have 32 such philtres. So for each of that philtre, we will have one,to the output. Yes. Yes. And then that will build up to 30 to do that. Yeah. Perfect. Perfect. Okay, So what happens now if we make the stride?Ooh! Okay, so now let's make the strive to what becomes the output size now? Does the output size change?instead. How much does it change? Uh, third dimension in the same 1. 27 1 27 127. So how did you come up with 1. 27?sir.

Do you want to write the formula they're given? You've got access toYes, Uh, like the formula, which, uh Okay, can you please repeat and I say important measure that is 256 in 2016 and a filtered site.and at that stage. the farm law of the output. The message will be and minus f s plus one. listen. so that would be a 56 minus.three dots. Bye. HM. That doesn't seems correct. It's two less 127. So now you've got 253 divided by two, right?So what happens? We've got a decimal number there. So I have that too. From the looks. you will take in digital partnership.If we have fraction, then we protect right? so Yeah. So that is the same formula. Uh, only were riding fighting out here. Right? Fighting is zero w minus scale over this. That's whywhich is fine. And then what you're saying is we are taking the interior part. So are we rounding up or are we rounding down?so if there is greater than five, then we are all being up. but now it's point. What do we do? I think running, don't you?", 'start_time': '01:00:20', 'end_time': '01:05:22'}, {'Topic': 'Feature Map Analysis', 'transcript': "Okay, so let's just take a small example of, uh, seven by seven image, right? and what is happening here when we are not doing a padding, So the first one is three by three.the philtre application. And then we're taking a stride of two, which means now we're starting from pixel, too.23. And, uh, so we're starting the numbering from zero. Right, So 0 to 6 is the pixel numbering. Okay,Right. And now we're doing a three by three. right. So the three by three the first philtre, then we're taking a stride of two.so we start from now 23 and four. And now we take another stride of two, which gives us now. four, five and six.right. So in this case, if we look at the formula, what's happening is N is seven minus three. great.stride is too so seven minus 3/2. which is three, right? So that's 4/2. That's 13, so we can see we have created three. Now the problem comes when we have an eight by eight image, right? And now we have an issue in that if we had another pixels in rows and columns.we basically not be able to do any further, right? So if we had an eight by eight image, if you can just draw that additional problem and go.Now, when we go for the stride of two, we are going over the edge, so we can't do anymore, right? So we are always looking at the number below, as the output were basically ignoring the that last follow. And that last room. Right? So we will always take the lower number out here.right. okay? So now my question is, how many parameters does the neural network have just in this layer?So who's gonna tell me that now? How many parameters? Now we've got 32 philtres. We've got a three by three philtres,right? And an RGB image. How many parameters do we need to learn in this? one pair of lives. who's gonna tell us?930 two.

So the reason why it's 27 by 32 and not nine by 32 it would be nine by 32 if we had a.grayscale image, right? We didn't have the channel. So you must always remember that we have got a three dimensional Fridawhere the third dimensions depth is defined by the number of input channels to that live. Okay, good. Now, what would be the number of parameters that needs to be learned? If we were not using CNN,we were actually using a multilayered percent promise. that depends on the number of notes hidden next to them. Iwant the same number of notes as I have in the hidden layer in the CNN. So how many notes do I have in the hidden layer in the CNN?trick questions. mhm. 56. Close to 56. Crusty. That is my input layer. Right? So that's 2. 56 times 2, 56 times three.that's the input Lear sites. what it was before.

I mean, we are comparing a very large number of parameters here with just 27 multiplied by 32.right, and this is a huge advantage of CNN. It's the weird. sharing with sharing. That's happening. That is a hugely important aspect.Oh, CNN. Okay, so you appreciate that. And what have we talked about that as the number of parameters increases, what do we need to do? We need a lot more data to learn them.right. And so we are actually talking about unnecessarily learning a lot of weights. Whereas we know that really what we're looking for is a scan through theright. So hopefully this is clear to you that actually the CNN can be represented as a multi layer perceptron also. So the multi layer Perceptron can do the work of the CNN as we see it right now, but the number of parameters is going to be much larger.okay, and so it's much more difficult to learn the same representation comparative.

I think hopefully everybody's got anybody. Got a question here? I know there are a few of you who have dealt with CNN's and done some deep learning. That does not mean that people who are not understanding this can't ask questions.Okay, So for those of you who are new to this, this is very, very important that you understand this. Okay, here's another. Okay, Let's go. There is another question I want to ask you, okay?which is the number of computations you're doing. so floating point operations, floating point operations do you need to do here? But I believe that as an exercise for you, let's carry on.okay? Okay, So next, uh, was trying to visualise these features. So? So what we have here is so he worked with it was that we took an RGB image.and used 32 philtres to create 32 future maps. Okay, so what we're basically doing is we are just, uh, cross finding the cross correlation of each of this philtre with entire image. So as we, uh, looked earlier, uh, visual representation of cross correlation. So I just wanted to visualise that what these 32 philtres look like. Okay, SoI'm going to show you that how they look like, So I'm using really 16 for that. That's an architecture. It's a CNN architecture, very common.So it has taken, uh, RGB images of size 24 by 24. And so these are, uh this is the basic basic architecture. So it has to conclusion blockseach using 64 philtres. It then has a max full, then to conclusion blocks of 128. uh, philtres each again for school and then three conclusions by, uh, containing 2. 56 philtres and so on. You can see here and then we have a fully connected layer. Uh, the final layer, which classifies each imagine 2000 categories.This is the basic architecture of this video. 16. So, what we're trying to do here that in each conclusion lock so you can see there are 60 for future maps. We will just see how the 16th of future maps look like.So there are 1 28 ft high maps. We will look at each of them. Okay. So for the sake of convenience, I am only displaying features for these four or five players. The first, the very first conclusion there. The fourth player. 7, 1114. Okay, so let's just have a look at them.So this is, uh, first, uh, output of the conclusion block. Okay, so in what is this image of a house? Okay. And, uh, there are three, philtres of this dimension three by three by three.right. So after, uh, cross correlation of one philtre with the entire image, we get one feature map like this.Okay. For 60 for Philtres, 50 for such 60. For such philtres, we have 64 future maps, so you can see that each of the philtre is, uh,trying to highlight some specific features. So if you see here, this philtre is highlighting grass here.uh, this philtre here is highlighting the pillars. Or you could say the vertical edges. Okay. And, uhthis philtre here is highlighting the door so you can see each philtre is, uh, targeting some features.All right, so next I'm moving on to the fourth layer. So this was the layer of confusion blocks having 128 philtres.Okay, so I'm not showing all of the 128 philtres just because it gets very messy. So these are just 60 for philtres out of this 1. 28 here. So you can see, uh, compared from this is compared from the first congressional put, this one has become a little bit more detailed or abstract. You could say there is a lot more detail. There is a lot more textual information here.Some, uh, very dark. Some are highlighting several features. Okay, this is the fourth layer next, moving on to the seventh layer so you can see, uh, things are getting more abstract here. It's difficult to describe what features. Uh, CNN is learning,but we can see that something different is happening with each feature map. So there is a definition of house here, but in here, we have totally lost it. Maybe this this philtre would was looking for something else. which is not present in this feature in this image,maybe something like that. Okay, so now we have reached 11th layer. It has, I think, 2. 56 philtres and I'm displaying only 64 corresponding feature maps out of these two physics. Okay, No, things have become more abstract. And then, you know, 15th layer,uh, things become even more abstract. You could see that that some freedom maps are, uh, not saying anything at all. For example, there's there's only slight activation here, but for some philtres, there are a lot of evacuations happening.", 'start_time': '01:16:42', 'end_time': '01:23:00'}, {'Topic': 'Feature Map Interpretations', 'transcript': "and in 17 player. So this has, uh, 512 feature maps and displaying only 64. You could see that only some some part of theafter the conclusion. Output has some information in it. Rest everything is just shut down. Okay, so let me just go through that again. So this is the first congressional put second. So ifeverybody realising that each of these small images is one layer now in that output right in this, so I shouldn't say one layer one feature, right? So one channel within the fourth layer. So everybody using, uh, you know, onepretty good right to generate each of these small images here, Right? And we're seeing What is it that it is learning from this image? And of course, this is the house. And, like, uh, was saying the V G architecture has been developed to learn 1000 different classes, right? So for different classes of images, you'll have different features, uh, getting highlighted right. And as we go throughright now, we are identifying edges and some relationships between those edges. But we're basically as we go, deeper and deeper,it actually becomes much more abstract, but is useful finally to make a classification that this is a house as opposed to an elephantright. Okay. Carry on group. Yeah. So this was the output of first conclusion block. 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th. And finally, we could use this output for classification. So basically, what we have done here is that we took an image and we extracted features out of that,and to some to that extent, that we are able to build a classified over it. That when we have an image of in house, we could say some features get activated if we have, uh, image of human that several different features get activated, and then we can use these activations to basically just classify or input dimension.Right. So here have how blood cells are. Okay, So the first output you could see here is that, uh, several feature maps are looking at the skin. Some are looking at beard. Some are looking at this the turbo and some are looking at the edges. So this is this little These feature maps would work for any human rights.On the second conclusion output, you could see things become more abstract. Then in third National Boardfort, you can see that this, uh, these features around here, they somehow represent I guess that human face that eyes and mouth Maybe that's my guess. I'm not sure.And again, in the just the final conclusion block things become very extracted. Only few future master activity dressed are just shut down.So here we have, uh, to human faces in the image so you could see in the final layer. So I'm showing, uh, all the 512 accusations here in the final conclusion block. So you could see, uh, things which are highlighted here in yellow.So similar features have been activated here. If you take a look at these two, these two here, and these two here, they look pretty similar.So we expect that any human, uh, face would excite these, uh, future maps of this, uh, Jeanette. And then later we can use this information, uh, to just classify that which category an image belongs to.Remember that the objective here is not to discriminate and identify between Luke and myself. Here. This is actually just to classify it into, uh, face versus house.Yes. So here we have a face versus house, so you can see that, uh, these are the features activated and different set of features activated in the final constitution outputso you can see they are not in this In this area, these we can have some not activity. any questions on this.Okay, Uh, we are at the end of the lecture, so I think Is this a good place to stop?

And since 1950 there's a lot of research going on. So one of the study done by Hubble and Weasel was, uh, they took a catand, uh, gave the card anaesthesia, so they forcefully kept the eyes opened up the card in the separatist, as you can see here.and they flashed a stimulus in front of cat's eyes. And in turn, they measure the electrical impulse generated in the brain in the brain of the cat. So they put electrodes in the brain. And whenever they would show some stimulus, there would be some neurons that would get excited, and they recorded that electric impulse.So what they did was, uh, showed some edges, uh, to the cat, some edges of various orientation, somewhere moving so you could see this board. This man is flashing this boat in front of the cat's eyes and in turn, they are recording the impulse in the cat's brain.Okay, so this was the experiment done by them, uh, human and basil.

So as we, uh, looked earlier, uh, visual representation of cross correlation. So I just wanted to visualise that what these 32 philtres look like. Okay, SoI'm going to show you that how they look like, So I'm using really 16 for that. That's an architecture. It's a CNN architecture, very common.So it has taken, uh, RGB images of size 24 by 24. And so these are, uh this is the basic basic architecture. So it has to conclusion blockseach using 64 philtres. It then has a max full, then to conclusion blocks of 128. uh, philtres each again for school and then three conclusions by, uh, containing 2. 56 philtres and so on. You can see here and then we have a fully connected layer. Uh, the final layer, which classifies each imagine 2000 categories.This is the basic architecture of this video. 16. So, what we're trying to do here that in each conclusion lock so you can see there are 60 for future maps. We will just see how the 16th of future maps look like.So there are 1 28 ft high maps. We will look at each of them. Okay. So for the sake of convenience, I am only displaying features for these four or five players. The first, the very first conclusion there. The fourth player. 7, 1114. Okay, so let's just have a look at them.So this is, uh, first, uh, output of the conclusion block. Okay, so in what is this image of a house? Okay. And, uh, there are three, philtres of this dimension three by three by three.right. So after, uh, cross correlation of one philtre with the entire image, we get one feature map like this.Okay. For 60 for Philtres, 50 for such 60. For such philtres, we have 64 future maps, so you can see that each of the philtre is, uh,trying to highlight some specific features. So if you see here, this philtre is highlighting grass here.uh, this philtre here is highlighting the pillars. Or you could say the vertical edges. Okay. And, uhthis philtre here is highlighting the door so you can see each philtre is, uh, targeting some features.All right, so next I'm moving on to the fourth layer. So this was the layer of confusion blocks having 128 philtres.Okay, so I'm not showing all of the 128 philtres just because it gets very messy. So these are just 60 for philtres out of this 1. 28 here. So you can see, uh, compared from this is compared from the first congressional put, this one has become a little bit more detailed or abstract. You could say there is a lot more detail. There is a lot more textual information here.Some, uh, very dark. Some are highlighting several features. Okay, this is the fourth layer next, moving on to the seventh layer so you can see, uh, things are getting more abstract here. It's difficult to describe what features. Uh, CNN is learning,but we can see that something different is happening with each feature map. So there is a definition of house here, but in here, we have totally lost it. Maybe this this philtre would was looking for something else. which is not present in this feature in this image,maybe something like that. Okay, so now we have reached 11th layer. It has, I think, 2. 56 philtres and I'm displaying only 64 corresponding feature maps out of these two physics. Okay, No, things have become more abstract. And then, you know, 15th layer,uh, things become even more abstract. You could see that that some freedom maps are, uh, not saying anything at all. For example, there's there's only slight activation here, but for some philtres, there are a lot of evacuations happening.and in 17 player. So this has, uh, 512 feature maps and displaying only 64. You could see that only some some part of theafter the conclusion. Output has some information in it. Rest everything is just shut down. Okay, so let me just go through that again. So this is the first congressional put second. So ifeverybody realising that each of these small images is one layer now in that output right in this, so I shouldn't say one layer one feature, right? So one channel within the fourth layer. So everybody using, uh, you know, onepretty good right to generate each of these small images here, Right? And we're seeing What is it that it is learning from this image? And of course, this is the house. And, like, uh, was saying the V G architecture has been developed to learn 1000 different classes, right? So for different classes of images, you'll have different features, uh, getting highlighted right. And as we go throughright now, we are identifying edges and some relationships between those edges. But we're basically as we go, deeper and deeper,it actually becomes much more abstract, but is useful finally to make a classification that this is a house as opposed to an elephantright. Okay. Carry on group. Yeah. So this was the output of first conclusion block. 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th. And finally, we could use this output for classification. So basically, what we have done here is that we took an image and we extracted features out of that,and to some to that extent, that we are able to build a classified over it. That when we have an image of in house, we could say some features get activated if we have, uh, image of human that several different features get activated, and then we can use these activations to basically just classify or input dimension.Right. So here have how blood cells are. Okay, So the first output you could see here is that, uh, several feature maps are looking at the skin. Some are looking at beard. Some are looking at this the turbo and some are looking at the edges. So this is this little These feature maps would work for any human rights.On the second conclusion output, you could see things become more abstract. Then in third National Boardfort, you can see that this, uh, these features around here, they somehow represent I guess that human face that eyes and mouth Maybe that's my guess. I'm not sure.And again, in the just the final conclusion block things become very extracted. Only few future master activity dressed are just shut down.So here we have, uh, to human faces in the image so you could see in the final layer. So I'm showing, uh, all the 512 accusations here in the final conclusion block. So you could see, uh, things which are highlighted here in yellow.So similar features have been activated here. If you take a look at these two, these two here, and these two here, they look pretty similar.So we expect that any human, uh, face would excite these, uh, future maps of this, uh, Jeanette. And then later we can use this information, uh, to just classify that which category an image belongs to.Remember that the objective here is not to discriminate and identify between Luke and myself. Here. This is actually just to classify it into, uh, face versus house.Yes. So here we have a face versus house, so you can see that, uh, these are the features activated and different set of features activated in the final constitution outputso you can see they are not in this In this area, these we can have some not activity. any questions on this.Okay, Uh, we are at the end of the lecture, so I think Is this a good place to stop?

So one of the study done by Hubble and Weasel was, uh, they took a catand, uh, gave the card anaesthesia, so they forcefully kept the eyes opened up the card in the separatist, as you can see here.and they flashed a stimulus in front of cat's eyes. And in turn, they measure the electrical impulse generated in the brain in the brain of the cat. So they put electrodes in the brain. And whenever they would show some stimulus, there would be some neurons that would get excited, and they recorded that electric impulse.So what they did was, uh, showed some edges, uh, to the cat, some edges of various orientation, somewhere moving so you could see this board. This man is flashing this boat in front of the cat's eyes and in turn, they are recording the impulse in the cat's brain.Okay, so this was the experiment done by them, uh, human and basil.

Let's say this is, uh, the probability of finding a 00.10 0.01 and sometimes they'd say, Okay, I have very high probability of occurrence of zero. So I take the maximum of all these and then say Okay,I have found So zero Harris means means that I have found that the zero. Okay, so that's confusing. That, uhthat's good. So it was probably in the mind of the students, so I just thought I'd cheque. So it's a maximum that you're taking That takes the maximum. Yes.", 'start_time': '00:16:06', 'end_time': '00:17:13'}, {'Topic': 'Feature Extraction and Hierarchy', 'transcript': "So this is where we have? Yeah, Yeah, for me. It's like 740. It's okay, but for seven, if we scan some part of seven and we could get one, right?Yeah, that's a valid problem. Uh, for that, uh, what we can do is we could we could add additional features. So that, uh, one so we can search for specific features, often digit digit. So let's say,uh, we could Instead of searching for the entire digit, we could search for some parts of it. So let's say if I have a feature like this, then maybe it's, uh indicates the presence of zero. Okay. And if I say that, Okay, there are four features which looks like this. They are coming in an image, so I can say, Okay, these are very close to zero, so you can just break that down into small features instead of taking into account the entire dignity.So what we're doing is we're hierarchically building this storey. So even another question that you should be asking at this point is that, uh, has chosen a box size that stores all of zero in it. Right? So also, he's shifting the scan that's taking place. He's shifting that, uh, square box in this exampleby a certain amount. Right. So if you are shifting by a certain amount, you might get part of the digit. Uh, and in fact, the square maybe too small to include the full digits. Right. So these are all questions that should be in your mind right now. Uh, now, the whole idea here is that we don't have to have one layer of, uhuh, somebody who needs to mute here. Uh, okay, So the idea here is that what has shown as a set of multi layer perceptron that are working on a small set of pixels in the neighbourhood,those are then being built upon by a second layer right, which is incorporating what are the features that have been seen in the previous player? So you're stacking up these features one on top of the other that are all essentially learning partial features to start with, and then more complete features, which then finally can lead to your classification.

Okay, so this is just building on on what you know right now, which is a multi level perception, right?Yeah, go on. Sorry. Thank you. So, uh, mhm. So the idea here is that while scanning this entire image, the MLP is saying we are using the same MLB. We're not changing its weight, so this is very important. So this is called wait sharing him here. So we are sharing the weights. We're not introducing new weights at every, uh, box here,so which helps in reducing the A total number of parameters.

So you must have you must be very familiar with this, uh, expression that output off any layer is basically a weighted sum of, uhuh, inputs to the input stood from previous layer and the weight. Right. So you're just basically Sundays and put some activation function. Might be sick model any any kind of non linearity. So in this scanning approach, we are also doing the same thing.

So this output would go here in the next,uh, and output from this second box, which is shifted slightly. It would be just a decent road here. So by doing this, you're just building a compact representation of this image here.Okay, So this is one level of hierarchy. You could add another level.

What do you think are the hyper parameters? Remember, the hyper parametersare defined when we, uh, you know, kind of, uh, they're not the model parameters. The weights that are connecting one layer input layer into the next hidden layer we're talking about hyper parameters is the definition ofthe architecture and other parameters that define that architecture. Right? So, for example, in linear regressionwhere we are using, uh, you know, say some regularisation. The regularisation constant is a hyper parameter, and the step size is a hyper parameter, right? We're still going to use gradient descent to learn the weights,but we, uh are defining. Uh, you know, uh, some other aspects of the network, right? So clearly step sizes. One hyper parameter here in a multilayered perceptron. What are the hyper parameters? It's the number of hidden nodes.and the number of hidden layers, right? Those are important hyper parameters.

So, as as government said in in one set of Philtres, you may be looking for horizontal lines in others, you may be looking at vertical lines, others you might be looking at, you know, uh,lines that are, in some way curved. Right? So you're looking for all of these different types of features. So when we talk about philtres, another way of thinking of these philtres these philtres comes from image processing,right where humans used to handcraft these philtres to extract features like edges and so on. Think of them as features that are being extracted, right? And so what you're now saying is you're getting this smaller sized image, which is the compaction. And then, as government has drawn these lines across these, uh, compact representations you're saying There are different features that are extracted from the same set of small number of.all located pixels, right?

The output layers out, putting, like you said,a non linear transformation of the weighted sum of the parts. But remember that we are looking for the same feature with this, uh, N box, right? And so as we scan across, we are not needing to change the way. It's because the weights define which feature we're extracting, whether it's a vertical line or a horizontal line at the simplest right, so we don't need to change the weights, and that's why we're doing we're sharing.okay. And then, similarly from the same set of pixels, we may want to have another feature extracted. So we are now got a new set of features and we're extracting that.

Is that what you're? Okay, So what you're saying is, how does the normalisation of pixel values affect the neural network?a good book. Do you want to take this socialite? Uh, so please go ahead. Okay. So essentially, visual, what happens with the neural network when your input layer, uh, is essentially got very differing skills, right for each of the teachers. Then what is happening to the cost function that you're trying to minimise this that is stretched in certain directions and squeezed in other directions.Right. So whenever you actually calculate the gradient, you start kind of bouncing between points and don't move necessarily in the direction that gives you the, uh, which leads you directly to the ideal, uh, solution. Right? So what happens when you scale or normalise the numbers, All of the skills of all of the inputs? What ends up happening is that you get a much more rounder shift,uh, cost function, and so you will actually start to now the first known more directly towards the minimum,so it speeds up the minimisation of the past.

It's learning these weights,right? So rather than us having to humanly created this, um, these philtres that we then know what kind of feature is going to be extracted by them by each application of the philtre throughout the image. What we are saying is we can actually now with neural networks, learn the weights, which will extract features that humans may not be able to interpret.but the neural network finds them useful. because they have been able to minimise the cost function as it is.does that make sense? so we are automatically extracting features that humans may not understand. right through each of these applications.

So after, uh, sliding this philtre on the original image we get this is everything in This is the output of the free to map. This is the sharpen philtre. This is the blur philtre. And this is an edge detector.Okay, so now, uh, there's another term which is called convolution, so it is very similar to, uh cross cross correlation. But the key idea here is that while doing these calculations, your future map will be rotated by one or two degrees.Okay. Uh, so there is a visual example here, so So let's say this is your fault. The A B C D e f g h i and this is your input image.and you want to calculate, uh, the feature at some representation for on the output. So let's say you take, uh, this portion of your input image.three by three matrix. And you, uh, take the dot product with the element byproduct with these metrics. So you see here they will be, uh, multiplied with zero B also with zero except the ICT. Uh, I will get multiplied with one, so the output would be, uh and it will go in this place in the place of centre of these metrics, so in here.so in here, the central element will be I right. So if you do this for this entire image, you will see that your failure just got flipped by 180 degrees.okay. And to see a visual representation. So consider this. This has an image where all are all elements are zero. Only one has very one. And this is how your philtre looks like. So there is the black edge black pixel on this, uh, left top and white on this bottom. Right. And after performing this cross correlation, your philtre just got flipped. The white is now here on the above.Okay, so the idea behind conclusion is that if you just, uh, flip your philtre by 12 degrees and then blue cross correlation. Uh, then this term is called Coalition. So the basic idea is that we are going to use this cross correlation and conclusion to find the mathematical expressions for back propagation, so it will come hand in later.okay. It's important to recognise that what is actually happening in the forward fast is actually cross correlation. It's not convolution.

So as we, uh, looked earlier, uh, visual representation of cross correlation. So I just wanted to visualise that what these 32 philtres look like. Okay, SoI'm going to show you that how they look like, So I'm using really 16 for that. That's an architecture. It's a CNN architecture, very common.So it has taken, uh, RGB images of size 24 by 24. And so these are, uh this is the basic basic architecture. So it has to conclusion blockseach using 64 philtres. It then has a max full, then to conclusion blocks of 128. uh, philtres each again for school and then three conclusions by, uh, containing 2. 56 philtres and so on. You can see here and then we have a fully connected layer. Uh, the final layer, which classifies each imagine 2000 categories.This is the basic architecture of this video. 16. So, what we're trying to do here that in each conclusion lock so you can see there are 60 for future maps. We will just see how the 16th of future maps look like.So there are 1 28 ft high maps. We will look at each of them. Okay. So for the sake of convenience, I am only displaying features for these four or five players. The first, the very first conclusion there. The fourth player. 7, 1114. Okay, so let's just have a look at them.So this is, uh, first, uh, output of the conclusion block. Okay, so in what is this image of a house? Okay. And, uh, there are three, philtres of this dimension three by three by three.right. So after, uh, cross correlation of one philtre with the entire image, we get one feature map like this.Okay. For 60 for Philtres, 50 for such 60. For such philtres, we have 64 future maps, so you can see that each of the philtre is, uh,trying to highlight some specific features. So if you see here, this philtre is highlighting grass here.uh, this philtre here is highlighting the pillars. Or you could say the vertical edges. Okay. And, uhthis philtre here is highlighting the door so you can see each philtre is, uh, targeting some features.All right, so next I'm moving on to the fourth layer. So this was the layer of confusion blocks having 128 philtres.Okay, so I'm not showing all of the 128 philtres just because it gets very messy. So these are just 60 for philtres out of this 1. 28 here. So you can see, uh, compared from this is compared from the first congressional put, this one has become a little bit more detailed or abstract. You could say there is a lot more detail. There is a lot more textual information here.Some, uh, very dark. Some are highlighting several features. Okay, this is the fourth layer next, moving on to the seventh layer so you can see, uh, things are getting more abstract here. It's difficult to describe what features. Uh, CNN is learning,but we can see that something different is happening with each feature map. So there is a definition of house here, but in here, we have totally lost it. Maybe this this philtre would was looking for something else. which is not present in this feature in this image,maybe something like that. Okay, so now we have reached 11th layer. It has, I think, 2. 56 philtres and I'm displaying only 64 corresponding feature maps out of these two physics. Okay, No, things have become more abstract. And then, you know, 15th layer,uh, things become even more abstract. You could see that that some freedom maps are, uh, not saying anything at all. For example, there's there's only slight activation here, but for some philtres, there are a lot of evacuations happening.and in 17 player. So this has, uh, 512 feature maps and displaying only 64. You could see that only some some part of theafter the conclusion. Output has some information in it. Rest everything is just shut down. Okay, so let me just go through that again. So this is the first congressional put second. So ifeverybody realising that each of these small images is one layer now in that output right in this, so I shouldn't say one layer one feature, right? So one channel within the fourth layer. So everybody using, uh, you know, onepretty good right to generate each of these small images here, Right? And we're seeing What is it that it is learning from this image? And of course, this is the house. And, like, uh, was saying the V G architecture has been developed to learn 1000 different classes, right? So for different classes of images, you'll have different features, uh, getting highlighted right. And as we go throughright now, we are identifying edges and some relationships between those edges. But we're basically as we go, deeper and deeper,it actually becomes much more abstract, but is useful finally to make a classification that this is a house as opposed to an elephantright. Okay. Carry on group. Yeah. So this was the output of first conclusion block. 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th. And finally, we could use this output for classification. So basically, what we have done here is that we took an image and we extracted features out of that,and to some to that extent, that we are able to build a classified over it. That when we have an image of in house, we could say some features get activated if we have, uh, image of human that several different features get activated, and then we can use these activations to basically just classify or input dimension.Right. So here have how blood cells are. Okay, So the first output you could see here is that, uh, several feature maps are looking at the skin. Some are looking at beard. Some are looking at this the turbo and some are looking at the edges. So this is this little These feature maps would work for any human rights.On the second conclusion output, you could see things become more abstract. Then in third National Boardfort, you can see that this, uh, these features around here, they somehow represent I guess that human face that eyes and mouth Maybe that's my guess. I'm not sure.And again, in the just the final conclusion block things become very extracted. Only few future master activity dressed are just shut down.So here we have, uh, to human faces in the image so you could see in the final layer. So I'm showing, uh, all the 512 accusations here in the final conclusion block. So you could see, uh, things which are highlighted here in yellow.So similar features have been activated here. If you take a look at these two, these two here, and these two here, they look pretty similar.So we expect that any human, uh, face would excite these, uh, future maps of this, uh, Jeanette. And then later we can use this information, uh, to just classify that which category an image belongs to.Remember that the objective here is not to discriminate and identify between Luke and myself. Here. This is actually just to classify it into, uh, face versus house.Yes. So here we have a face versus house, so you can see that, uh, these are the features activated and different set of features activated in the final constitution outputso you can see they are not in this In this area, these we can have some not activity. any questions on this.Okay, Uh, we are at the end of the lecture, so I think Is this a good place to stop? Yes. Great. Excellent. Okay. So thank you so much for this. I think that's been wonderful.

So again, here is an example of dog from different, uh, angles. They're different sizes, different angles of the storey.so coming to some history of CNN's. So this problem has been quite well known. And since 1950 there's a lot of research going on. So one of the study done by Hubble and Weasel was, uh, they took a catand, uh, gave the card anaesthesia, so they forcefully kept the eyes opened up the card in the separatist, as you can see here.and they flashed a stimulus in front of cat's eyes. And in turn, they measure the electrical impulse generated in the brain in the brain of the cat. So they put electrodes in the brain. And whenever they would show some stimulus, there would be some neurons that would get excited, and they recorded that electric impulse.So what they did was, uh, showed some edges, uh, to the cat, some edges of various orientation, somewhere moving so you could see this board. This man is flashing this boat in front of the cat's eyes and in turn, they are recording the impulse in the cat's brain.Okay, so this was the experiment done by them, uh, human and basil. And the key findings were that, uh, there are some cells which get activated, uh, by some small edges or moving edges.Okay. And some cells are often direction specific. They only get excited when some edges being shown to them, Huh? Which is sliding from a particular direction onlyand, uh, there are higher higher level of cells, uh, more complex cells, which are selected with the length of the moving edge. So these kinds of these features simply build up over each other. So this was the key findings from the experiment.Okay, So that, uh, without losing the spatial invariance, how could we without flattening them? And how could we use that? So they figured out that somehow you need to build some hierarchy into the model to preserve the spatial information.Okay, So these experiments basically set the stage for, uh, some outstanding research for the next 20 years and building on these ideas in 1986.

Okay, so let's say, uh, this isn't modified image image, so I have just shrink the zero and, uh, introduced some translation variance. So what I'm doing here is that I took a simple MLP.You can call it, uh, zero director for now. It only detects if, uh, zero is present in some part of image or not. Okay, so, uh, what I'm doing here is I'm taking small part of the image and then flattening it. Okay,so, uh, let's say it has, uh, 2020 some 400 pixels here. Okay, Le, let's assume that this is a small part of this entire image and then flattening it and then putting it into one MLP. Okay, then I'm scanning across all this, uh, this entire image and looking for occurrence of zero.So what is the output of this? MLP would be, uh, probability distribution between 0 to, uh 1 which says that if it has detected zero or not. So if it thinks that the image which was cast into this MLP contains a zero, it will have a very high probability, otherwise very low probability.Okay, so I'm just scanning this entire image, using my MLP who look for the zero. Okay. So once I have scanned the entire image. And if I see if at any place there was a high output from a model, then I would say, Okay, I have found a zero. So in this way.

Let's just make sure that everybody is following this. Right. So, uh, guys, what? What do you think? Here are some of the hyper parameters.in what has been discussed up until now. What do you think are the hyper parameters? Remember, the hyper parametersare defined when we, uh, you know, kind of, uh, they're not the model parameters. The weights that are connecting one layer input layer into the next hidden layer we're talking about hyper parameters is the definition ofthe architecture and other parameters that define that architecture. Right? So, for example, in linear regressionwhere we are using, uh, you know, say some regularisation. The regularisation constant is a hyper parameter, and the step size is a hyper parameter, right? We're still going to use gradient descent to learn the weights,but we, uh are defining. Uh, you know, uh, some other aspects of the network, right? So clearly step sizes. One hyper parameter here in a multilayered perceptron. What are the hyper parameters? It's the number of hidden nodes.and the number of hidden layers, right? Those are important hyper parameters. So what do you think are the hyper parameters here?maybe the ship. The shift. Science. Okay, so one of them is the shift size. That's good. what else? sorry.Philtre sides. So by philtre you're referring to the size of the square that we are shifting. Right, So good. Okay.What else? Number of philtres. Number of Philtres, Okay. a number of hidden layers. So what are we showing here? What is this,uh, diagram showing you each of these layers that you're seeing here? Uh, you know, so that we've got this image, the input image,right? And from each of the input images where we are creating one of these blue, uh, kind of compact representations, each of those blue compact representations aredifferent Philtres, right? So, as as government said in in one set of Philtres, you may be looking for horizontal lines in others, you may be looking at vertical lines, others you might be looking at, you know, uh,lines that are, in some way curved. Right? So you're looking for all of these different types of features. So when we talk about philtres, another way of thinking of these philtres these philtres comes from image processing,right where humans used to handcraft these philtres to extract features like edges and so on. Think of them as features that are being extracted, right? And so what you're now saying is you're getting this smaller sized image, which is the compaction. And then, as government has drawn these lines across these, uh, compact representations you're saying There are different features that are extracted from the same set of small number of.all located pixels, right? So philtre is nothing other than an M by N box right that defines which philtres are which pixels are connected to each other.in that MLP. So earlier, the multi layer Perceptron be flattened out the whole image. Now we only flattening out a small piece, which is this m by N box, which we're calling peopleright? And that's getting flattened and it can have a multilayered perceptron that finally gives an output. Now we're actually using a very simple multi layer perceptron here.which is essentially just got an input and an output layer. The output layers out, putting, like you said,a non linear transformation of the weighted sum of the parts. But remember that we are looking for the same feature with this, uh, N box, right? And so as we scan across, we are not needing to change the way.

So the key idea. So the key findings from about exercise for where that model does not generalise. Well, okay, so we need a model which have some degree of spatial invariance so we could have translation invariance.Okay, if we shift the digits slightly, the model's performance should not be, uh, affected drastically. So some amount of rotation should also be taken into account,right? And some amount of side invariants elimination invariants all these kinds of things should be taken into account. Okay, So I would just like you to just keep this in your mind. That what problem? Uh, what, uh, how would you solve this problem? What kind of architecture could you use?", 'start_time': '00:06:36', 'end_time': '00:09:52'}, {'Topic': 'Spatial Invariance in CNNs', 'transcript': "Okay. And the key idea is that by flattening the image, we lose the spatial information, which is very important. So we need to think some, uh, some other activity does not flatten the imageOkay. So again, here is an example of dog from different, uh, angles. They're different sizes, different angles of the storey.so coming to some history of CNN's. So this problem has been quite well known. And since 1950 there's a lot of research going on. So one of the study done by Hubble and Weasel was, uh, they took a catand, uh, gave the card anaesthesia, so they forcefully kept the eyes opened up the card in the separatist, as you can see here.and they flashed a stimulus in front of cat's eyes. And in turn, they measure the electrical impulse generated in the brain in the brain of the cat. So they put electrodes in the brain. And whenever they would show some stimulus, there would be some neurons that would get excited, and they recorded that electric impulse.So what they did was, uh, showed some edges, uh, to the cat, some edges of various orientation, somewhere moving so you could see this board. This man is flashing this boat in front of the cat's eyes and in turn, they are recording the impulse in the cat's brain.Okay, so this was the experiment done by them, uh, human and basil. And the key findings were that, uh, there are some cells which get activated, uh, by some small edges or moving edges.Okay. And some cells are often direction specific. They only get excited when some edges being shown to them, Huh? Which is sliding from a particular direction onlyand, uh, there are higher higher level of cells, uh, more complex cells, which are selected with the length of the moving edge. So these kinds of these features simply build up over each other. So this was the key findings from the experiment.Okay, So that, uh, without losing the spatial invariance, how could we without flattening them? And how could we use that? So they figured out that somehow you need to build some hierarchy into the model to preserve the spatial information.Okay, So these experiments basically set the stage for, uh, some outstanding research for the next 20 years and building on these ideas in 1986. Uh, there was, uh, scientists called Fukushima, so he built something called neo cabinet trump.", 'start_time': '00:09:52', 'end_time': '00:12:47'}, {'Topic': 'Historical Context of CNNs', 'transcript': "So it's basically an architecture. It was an unsurprised, uh, machine learning based architecture, which used to which was used to, uh, recognise digits.And it was the state of the art at its time. But some people said that due to, uh, computational limitations, they were not able to take it to the next close. Okay. And in the 19 nineties, building on these ideas, uh, so he was able to create first successful, uh, conclusion neural network. And it was called Lane at five. So it was the first successful demonstration for character recognition,uh, without, like, frightening damage. So we will discuss about this.

And I want you all to think that how would you use this information To modify the existing neural network, which you have trained and administrators, uh, so that it is more robust to spatial invariance. Like how we approach this problem? Just think for a moment.Okay, So the solution would be to just stand for digits. Okay, so let's say, uh, this isn't modified image image, so I have just shrink the zero and, uh, introduced some translation variance. So what I'm doing here is that I took a simple MLP.You can call it, uh, zero director for now. It only detects if, uh, zero is present in some part of image or not. Okay, so, uh, what I'm doing here is I'm taking small part of the image and then flattening it. Okay,so, uh, let's say it has, uh, 2020 some 400 pixels here. Okay, Le, let's assume that this is a small part of this entire image and then flattening it and then putting it into one MLP. Okay, then I'm scanning across all this, uh, this entire image and looking for occurrence of zero.So what is the output of this? MLP would be, uh, probability distribution between 0 to, uh 1 which says that if it has detected zero or not. So if it thinks that the image which was cast into this MLP contains a zero, it will have a very high probability, otherwise very low probability.Okay, so I'm just scanning this entire image, using my MLP who look for the zero. Okay. So once I have scanned the entire image. And if I see if at any place there was a high output from a model, then I would say, Okay, I have found a zero. So in this way. So this is the idea that by scanning, we can, uh, actually, uh, use some kind of, uh, introduce some kind of special robustness. So, uh, relevant of this, uh, space where? Irrelevant of location.", 'start_time': '00:13:37', 'end_time': '00:16:06'}, {'Topic': 'Hyperparameters in CNNs', 'transcript': "Okay, so that's that's great. Let's just make sure that everybody is following this. Right. So, uh, guys, what? What do you think? Here are some of the hyper parameters.in what has been discussed up until now. What do you think are the hyper parameters? Remember, the hyper parametersare defined when we, uh, you know, kind of, uh, they're not the model parameters. The weights that are connecting one layer input layer into the next hidden layer we're talking about hyper parameters is the definition ofthe architecture and other parameters that define that architecture. Right? So, for example, in linear regressionwhere we are using, uh, you know, say some regularisation. The regularisation constant is a hyper parameter, and the step size is a hyper parameter, right? We're still going to use gradient descent to learn the weights,but we, uh are defining. Uh, you know, uh, some other aspects of the network, right? So clearly step sizes. One hyper parameter here in a multilayered perceptron. What are the hyper parameters? It's the number of hidden nodes.and the number of hidden layers, right? Those are important hyper parameters. So what do you think are the hyper parameters here?maybe the ship. The shift. Science. Okay, so one of them is the shift size. That's good. what else? sorry.Philtre sides. So by philtre you're referring to the size of the square that we are shifting. Right, So good. Okay.What else? Number of philtres. Number of Philtres, Okay. a number of hidden layers. So what are we showing here? What is this,uh, diagram showing you each of these layers that you're seeing here? Uh, you know, so that we've got this image, the input image,right? And from each of the input images where we are creating one of these blue, uh, kind of compact representations, each of those blue compact representations aredifferent Philtres, right? So, as as government said in in one set of Philtres, you may be looking for horizontal lines in others, you may be looking at vertical lines, others you might be looking at, you know, uh,lines that are, in some way curved. Right? So you're looking for all of these different types of features. So when we talk about philtres, another way of thinking of these philtres these philtres comes from image processing,right where humans used to handcraft these philtres to extract features like edges and so on. Think of them as features that are being extracted, right? And so what you're now saying is you're getting this smaller sized image, which is the compaction. And then, as government has drawn these lines across these, uh, compact representations you're saying There are different features that are extracted from the same set of small number of.all located pixels, right? So philtre is nothing other than an M by N box right that defines which philtres are which pixels are connected to each other.in that MLP. So earlier, the multi layer Perceptron be flattened out the whole image. Now we only flattening out a small piece, which is this m by N box, which we're calling peopleright? And that's getting flattened and it can have a multilayered perceptron that finally gives an output. Now we're actually using a very simple multi layer perceptron here.which is essentially just got an input and an output layer. The output layers out, putting, like you said,a non linear transformation of the weighted sum of the parts. But remember that we are looking for the same feature with this, uh, N box, right? And so as we scan across, we are not needing to change the way. It's because the weights define which feature we're extracting, whether it's a vertical line or a horizontal line at the simplest right, so we don't need to change the weights, and that's why we're doing we're sharing.", 'start_time': '00:23:44', 'end_time': '00:29:00'}, {'Topic': 'Convolution and Pooling', 'transcript': "So we'll have one future map similarly for six philtre six philtres. You have six feature maps. Okay. And then there is a layer called sub sampling. So where you just, uh, take the max? Uh, just sample down. So, uh, one of the most common, uh, sub sampling technique is called Max pooling. So what they do here is they take two by two, sample out of this feature map and say this has value one. This is 263, and this is forso they take the maximum out of it and say so. This, uh, two by two matrix has four as the maximum value. So for the next, uh, through the next feature map, the four will be representing one pixel here instead of four pixels.Okay, So this is basically how we sub samples. So we are just if it has 2828 dimensions, then the output will have 14 by 14 dimensions by using this, uh, two by two Max schooling.Okay, so this is called sub sampling, and then we have another conclusion. Blog, another sub sampling layer, and then we have a fully connected layer. So this is the layer which actually does the classification into 10 outputs for administrator. They will pretend for any other data. There would be different number of classes Where, uh, where we want to classify our input image to be.uh, is this clear? So we will understand all these terms, uh, in the next slaves. So this is the typical architecture. So every architecture of the CNN has some, uh, modification of it,okay.

So this problem has been quite well known. And since 1950 there's a lot of research going on. So one of the study done by Hubble and Weasel was, uh, they took a catand, uh, gave the card anaesthesia, so they forcefully kept the eyes opened up the card in the separatist, as you can see here.and they flashed a stimulus in front of cat's eyes. And in turn, they measure the electrical impulse generated in the brain in the brain of the cat. So they put electrodes in the brain. And whenever they would show some stimulus, there would be some neurons that would get excited, and they recorded that electric impulse.So what they did was, uh, showed some edges, uh, to the cat, some edges of various orientation, somewhere moving so you could see this board. This man is flashing this boat in front of the cat's eyes and in turn, they are recording the impulse in the cat's brain.Okay, so this was the experiment done by them, uh, human and basil. And the key findings were that, uh, there are some cells which get activated, uh, by some small edges or moving edges.Okay. And some cells are often direction specific. They only get excited when some edges being shown to them, Huh? Which is sliding from a particular direction onlyand, uh, there are higher higher level of cells, uh, more complex cells, which are selected with the length of the moving edge. So these kinds of these features simply build up over each other. So this was the key findings from the experiment.Okay, So that, uh, without losing the spatial invariance, how could we without flattening them? And how could we use that? So they figured out that somehow you need to build some hierarchy into the model to preserve the spatial information.Okay, So these experiments basically set the stage for, uh, some outstanding research for the next 20 years and building on these ideas in 1986. Uh, there was, uh, scientists called Fukushima, so he built something called neo cabinet trump.So it's basically an architecture. It was an unsurprised, uh, machine learning based architecture, which used to which was used to, uh, recognise digits.And it was the state of the art at its time. But some people said that due to, uh, computational limitations, they were not able to take it to the next close. Okay.

Okay, so let's say, uh, this isn't modified image image, so I have just shrink the zero and, uh, introduced some translation variance. So what I'm doing here is that I took a simple MLP.You can call it, uh, zero director for now. It only detects if, uh, zero is present in some part of image or not. Okay, so, uh, what I'm doing here is I'm taking small part of the image and then flattening it. Okay,so, uh, let's say it has, uh, 2020 some 400 pixels here. Okay, Le, let's assume that this is a small part of this entire image and then flattening it and then putting it into one MLP.

So I take the maximum of all these and then say Okay,I have found So zero Harris means means that I have found that the zero. Okay, so that's confusing. That, uhthat's good. So it was probably in the mind of the students, so I just thought I'd cheque. So it's a maximum that you're taking That takes the maximum. Yes.So this is where we have? Yeah, Yeah, for me. It's like 740. It's okay, but for seven, if we scan some part of seven and we could get one, right?Yeah, that's a valid problem. Uh, for that, uh, what we can do is we could we could add additional features. So that, uh, one so we can search for specific features, often digit digit. So let's say,uh, we could Instead of searching for the entire digit, we could search for some parts of it. So let's say if I have a feature like this, then maybe it's, uh indicates the presence of zero. Okay. And if I say that, Okay, there are four features which looks like this. They are coming in an image, so I can say, Okay, these are very close to zero, so you can just break that down into small features instead of taking into account the entire dignity.So what we're doing is we're hierarchically building this storey. So even another question that you should be asking at this point is that, uh, has chosen a box size that stores all of zero in it. Right? So also, he's shifting the scan that's taking place. He's shifting that, uh, square box in this exampleby a certain amount. Right. So if you are shifting by a certain amount, you might get part of the digit. Uh, and in fact, the square maybe too small to include the full digits. Right. So these are all questions that should be in your mind right now.

So you're stacking up these features one on top of the other that are all essentially learning partial features to start with, and then more complete features, which then finally can lead to your classification.

Let's just make sure that everybody is following this. Right. So, uh, guys, what? What do you think? Here are some of the hyper parameters.in what has been discussed up until now. What do you think are the hyper parameters? Remember, the hyper parametersare defined when we, uh, you know, kind of, uh, they're not the model parameters. The weights that are connecting one layer input layer into the next hidden layer we're talking about hyper parameters is the definition ofthe architecture and other parameters that define that architecture. Right? So, for example, in linear regressionwhere we are using, uh, you know, say some regularisation. The regularisation constant is a hyper parameter, and the step size is a hyper parameter, right? We're still going to use gradient descent to learn the weights,but we, uh are defining. Uh, you know, uh, some other aspects of the network, right? So clearly step sizes. One hyper parameter here in a multilayered perceptron. What are the hyper parameters? It's the number of hidden nodes.and the number of hidden layers, right? Those are important hyper parameters. So what do you think are the hyper parameters here?maybe the ship. The shift. Science. Okay, so one of them is the shift size. That's good. what else? sorry.Philtre sides. So by philtre you're referring to the size of the square that we are shifting. Right, So good. Okay.What else? Number of philtres. Number of Philtres, Okay. a number of hidden layers. So what are we showing here? What is this,uh, diagram showing you each of these layers that you're seeing here? Uh, you know, so that we've got this image, the input image,right? And from each of the input images where we are creating one of these blue, uh, kind of compact representations, each of those blue compact representations aredifferent Philtres, right? So, as as government said in in one set of Philtres, you may be looking for horizontal lines in others, you may be looking at vertical lines, others you might be looking at, you know, uh,lines that are, in some way curved. Right? So you're looking for all of these different types of features. So when we talk about philtres, another way of thinking of these philtres these philtres comes from image processing,right where humans used to handcraft these philtres to extract features like edges and so on. Think of them as features that are being extracted, right? And so what you're now saying is you're getting this smaller sized image, which is the compaction. And then, as government has drawn these lines across these, uh, compact representations you're saying There are different features that are extracted from the same set of small number of.all located pixels, right? So philtre is nothing other than an M by N box right that defines which philtres are which pixels are connected to each other.in that MLP. So earlier, the multi layer Perceptron be flattened out the whole image. Now we only flattening out a small piece, which is this m by N box, which we're calling peopleright? And that's getting flattened and it can have a multilayered perceptron that finally gives an output. Now we're actually using a very simple multi layer perceptron here.which is essentially just got an input and an output layer. The output layers out, putting, like you said,a non linear transformation of the weighted sum of the parts. But remember that we are looking for the same feature with this, uh, N box, right? And so as we scan across, we are not needing to change the way. It's because the weights define which feature we're extracting, whether it's a vertical line or a horizontal line at the simplest right, so we don't need to change the weights, and that's why we're doing we're sharing.okay. And then, similarly from the same set of pixels, we may want to have another feature extracted. So we are now got a new set of features and we're extracting that. The other thing to remember is right now is only talking about black and white image grayscale image.If we had a colour image, then we would actually the spirit er would not be an M by N. box. It would actually be a three dimensional box right where the third dimensionis three. So it's a M by n by three or the image that is a colour image which has got the red, green and blue.channels. right. So one way of visualising this you've got an image of some size. You are reducing the size of the image by doing the scanningright. And with every feature that you're creating is like another channel. Right? So we went from RGB Channel to another description of the same data which has a smaller X and Y axis as such of the image. But it has a depth to it, which is the number of features that have been extracted. Right. And this is a very common feature that you will see when you book shows you the more complicated structures of a CNN.You'll find that you start off with a large image with three channels and you end up with very small images, but with lots of features, lots of channels with it.Right.

Uh, the left, the left, and the first element in this, uh,read matrix is 103. You can see it here. right. So you're multiplying it with zero and then 128 with minus one and so on and so forth.

Okay, so, uh, the input here is, uh, before we go into the architecture, can we just, uh, do a little bit of discussion around how the philtre size impact, the output image size, But is that coming after this?Yes. I was just trying to bring Troy. I don't have, uh Okay. Okay.

And this three, the depth is coming from the input. because the input image has three channels as death. So you're each philtre will also have a depth of three.

Okay, So with the stride of one pixel means that you're shifting by one pixel to the right all the way till you get to the end of the image, right?

For those of you who don't know about padding, just don't worry about it. Just tell us what is going to be the size of the image that comes out on the other side when we do the scanning. Now the stride works left to rightand talk to bottom. right. So as you scan across, you're going one pixel at a time and going to the next position where the philtre is applied. And then when you get to the end, you shift the philtre down by one,uh, pixel and apply it again. Correct? Yes, sir. Okay. So what is going to be the size of the image that is coming out on the other end? Or the the two dimensional array that's coming out at the end? Because remember what is sayingthat the three by three by three is producing only one number, so the multilayered Perceptron is taking27 inputs and is out putting one value.

So one person said to 54.And what was the other person saying? I think, uh, zero comma zero is concerned at the centre, and, uh, the other things are taken at that size in the same way you look at work,right? So, like I said, the we are resuming zero padding go padding right now. Right? So your philtre starts from the edge and takes the first three into account.right, and then it moves by one and moves by one. Right? So the size is going to be there. One answer that's been given us 254.Is that the number of rows or the number of columns, or what is to 54? I think both.

Does the output size change?instead. How much does it change? Uh, third dimension in the same 1. 27 1 27 127. So how did you come up with 1. 27?sir.

Do you want to write the formula they're given? You've got access toYes, Uh, like the formula, which, uh Okay, can you please repeat and I say important measure that is 256 in 2016 and a filtered site.and at that stage. the farm law of the output. The message will be and minus f s plus one. listen. so that would be a 56 minus.three dots. Bye. HM. That doesn't seems correct. It's two less 127.

So are we rounding up or are we rounding down?so if there is greater than five, then we are all being up. but now it's point. What do we do? I think running, don't you?Okay, so let's just take a small example of, uh, seven by seven image, right? and what is happening here when we are not doing a padding, So the first one is three by three.the philtre application. And then we're taking a stride of two, which means now we're starting from pixel, too.23. And, uh, so we're starting the numbering from zero. Right, So 0 to 6 is the pixel numbering. Okay,Right. And now we're doing a three by three. right. So the three by three the first philtre, then we're taking a stride of two.so we start from now 23 and four.

And then, you know, 15th layer,uh, things become even more abstract. You could see that that some freedom maps are, uh, not saying anything at all. For example, there's there's only slight activation here, but for some philtres, there are a lot of evacuations happening.and in 17 player. So this has, uh, 512 feature maps and displaying only 64. You could see that only some some part of theafter the conclusion. Output has some information in it. Rest everything is just shut down. Okay, so let me just go through that again. So this is the first congressional put second. So ifeverybody realising that each of these small images is one layer now in that output right in this, so I shouldn't say one layer one feature, right? So one channel within the fourth layer. So everybody using, uh, you know, onepretty good right to generate each of these small images here, Right? And we're seeing What is it that it is learning from this image? And of course, this is the house. And, like, uh, was saying the V G architecture has been developed to learn 1000 different classes, right? So for different classes of images, you'll have different features, uh, getting highlighted right. And as we go throughright now, we are identifying edges and some relationships between those edges. But we're basically as we go, deeper and deeper,it actually becomes much more abstract, but is useful finally to make a classification that this is a house as opposed to an elephantright. Okay. Carry on group. Yeah. So this was the output of first conclusion block. 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th. And finally, we could use this output for classification. So basically, what we have done here is that we took an image and we extracted features out of that,and to some to that extent, that we are able to build a classified over it. That when we have an image of in house, we could say some features get activated if we have, uh, image of human that several different features get activated, and then we can use these activations to basically just classify or input dimension.Right. So here have how blood cells are. Okay, So the first output you could see here is that, uh, several feature maps are looking at the skin. Some are looking at beard. Some are looking at this the turbo and some are looking at the edges. So this is this little These feature maps would work for any human rights.On the second conclusion output, you could see things become more abstract. Then in third National Boardfort, you can see that this, uh, these features around here, they somehow represent I guess that human face that eyes and mouth Maybe that's my guess. I'm not sure.And again, in the just the final conclusion block things become very extracted. Only few future master activity dressed are just shut down.So here we have, uh, to human faces in the image so you could see in the final layer. So I'm showing, uh, all the 512 accusations here in the final conclusion block. So you could see, uh, things which are highlighted here in yellow.So similar features have been activated here. If you take a look at these two, these two here, and these two here, they look pretty similar.So we expect that any human, uh, face would excite these, uh, future maps of this, uh, Jeanette. And then later we can use this information, uh, to just classify that which category an image belongs to.Remember that the objective here is not to discriminate and identify between Luke and myself. Here. This is actually just to classify it into, uh, face versus house.Yes. So here we have a face versus house, so you can see that, uh, these are the features activated and different set of features activated in the final constitution outputso you can see they are not in this In this area, these we can have some not activity. any questions on this.Okay, Uh, we are at the end of the lecture, so I think Is this a good place to stop? Yes. Great. Excellent. Okay. So thank you so much for this. I think that's been wonderful. Uh, folks, uh, carry on with CNN's in on Saturday, so if there are no questions now, we'll end this session.Okay. No questions. So I'm ending the session. Thank you. Thanks, everyone. Thank you, sir.", 'keywords': ['CNN', 'Feature Maps', 'Image Classification'], 'summary': 'The session concludes with a detailed discussion on visualizing features extracted from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using RGB images and various filter configurations. The speaker explains the architecture of a CNN, particularly focusing on the use of multiple convolutional blocks, each processing the input image with different sets of filters to create feature maps. Throughout the layers, the features become increasingly abstract, making it more challenging to interpret them directly. The speaker demonstrates how filters correspond to specific features such as edges and textures in the input images, and how these features evolve through the network layers. The final output is used to classify different images, showcasing the activation of filters related to recognized patterns, such as human faces versus houses. The session ends with a confirmation of understanding and a note on the continuation of CNN topics in upcoming lectures.'}], 'yellow_line': [{'Topic': 'Technical Setup', 'transcript': 'Can you try and share your screen?

Little networks won't do it on images or several other kinds of data. So why do we need CNN? First, we'll discuss that and then some history regarding what work has been done regarding CNN's andThen we will see the basic building blocks and different layers which people have came across.

So And they have one digit from 0 to 9 representing in that image.So basically, a simple MLP for, uh would require you to flatten this image. So you flatten it out into a 287, 84 dimensional victor one by 74uh, Dimension vector. And you just fit a simple multi layer perceptron into it and classify each input into one of the 10 classes.So this is the typical, uh, workflow for amnesty, and we are easily able to achieve 95 maybe 98% accuracy on the state of using very simple Uh, okay,', 'start_time': '00:05:52', 'end_time': '00:06:49'}, {'Topic': 'Image Classification Techniques', 'transcript': "So a typical output for for the last level look something like this. So this is a 10 dimensions input output. So this is the zero index, and this is the ninth index. So, uh, each the index. Basically, it tells you what is the budget on this image. So for this in 49 you can see the ninth, uh, value in this output. Uh, this is basically a probability distribution.So the ninth area has the ninth value. Sorry. The 10th value, The last value has the value of 0.99. So the model is very confident that this image contains the ninth.Similarly, for three, you can see the third index has, uh, like a perfect one probability for being three. And similarly, for two, you have this. So what I did was simply I just, uh,changed the input to the, uh, neural network, which was trained on this administrator. So I just shrink the images slightly and, uh, changed the position where the budgets were so earlier. It was just sent in central incentive, but now I am putting these digits on the sideways, and they are slightly smaller than earlier So what happened immediately was that the predictions were very messed up.So the model thinks that this budget is 012345. So the model think it's five, but it's actually zero. So you see that, uh, only with a slide shift of the image, the model's performance has reduced drastically. Similarly, for six, the model thinks it is 0123456.uh sure. Uh Yeah. So the model thinks 87. Okay, but, uh, So the key idea here is that the predictions got messed up similarly with one hair. So we would expect this to be the outfit of your model, but model was predicting this. So there is some error. So we need to make which is robust to these, uh, these kinds of variations,okay. So the key idea. So the key findings from about exercise for where that model does not generalise. Well, okay, so we need a model which have some degree of spatial invariance so we could have translation invariance.Okay, if we shift the digits slightly, the model's performance should not be, uh, affected drastically. So some amount of rotation should also be taken into account,right? And some amount of side invariants elimination invariants all these kinds of things should be taken into account. Okay, So I would just like you to just keep this in your mind. That what problem? Uh, what, uh, how would you solve this problem? What kind of architecture could you use?", 'start_time': '00:06:49', 'end_time': '00:09:52'}, {'Topic': 'Spatial Invariance in CNNs', 'transcript': "Okay.

So this problem has been quite well known. And since 1950 there's a lot of research going on. So one of the study done by Hubble and Weasel was, uh, they took a catand, uh, gave the card anaesthesia, so they forcefully kept the eyes opened up the card in the separatist, as you can see here.and they flashed a stimulus in front of cat's eyes. And in turn, they measure the electrical impulse generated in the brain in the brain of the cat. So they put electrodes in the brain. And whenever they would show some stimulus, there would be some neurons that would get excited, and they recorded that electric impulse.So what they did was, uh, showed some edges, uh, to the cat, some edges of various orientation, somewhere moving so you could see this board. This man is flashing this boat in front of the cat's eyes and in turn, they are recording the impulse in the cat's brain.Okay, so this was the experiment done by them, uh, human and basil. And the key findings were that, uh, there are some cells which get activated, uh, by some small edges or moving edges.Okay. And some cells are often direction specific. They only get excited when some edges being shown to them, Huh? Which is sliding from a particular direction onlyand, uh, there are higher higher level of cells, uh, more complex cells, which are selected with the length of the moving edge. So these kinds of these features simply build up over each other. So this was the key findings from the experiment.Okay, So that, uh, without losing the spatial invariance, how could we without flattening them? And how could we use that? So they figured out that somehow you need to build some hierarchy into the model to preserve the spatial information.Okay, So these experiments basically set the stage for, uh, some outstanding research for the next 20 years and building on these ideas in 1986. Uh, there was, uh, scientists called Fukushima, so he built something called neo cabinet trump.So it's basically an architecture. It was an unsurprised, uh, machine learning based architecture, which used to which was used to, uh, recognise digits.And it was the state of the art at its time. But some people said that due to, uh, computational limitations, they were not able to take it to the next close. Okay. And in the 19 nineties, building on these ideas, uh, so he was able to create first successful, uh, conclusion neural network. And it was called Lane at five. So it was the first successful demonstration for character recognition,uh, without, like, frightening damage. So we will discuss about this. Architecture it in the spotlight.", 'start_time': '00:10:17', 'end_time': '00:13:36'}, {'Topic': 'Neural Network Modifications', 'transcript': "Okay, So now I would like to pause for a moment. And I want you all to think that how would you use this information To modify the existing neural network, which you have trained and administrators, uh, so that it is more robust to spatial invariance. Like how we approach this problem? Just think for a moment.Okay, So the solution would be to just stand for digits. Okay, so let's say, uh, this isn't modified image image, so I have just shrink the zero and, uh, introduced some translation variance. So what I'm doing here is that I took a simple MLP.You can call it, uh, zero director for now. It only detects if, uh, zero is present in some part of image or not. Okay, so, uh, what I'm doing here is I'm taking small part of the image and then flattening it. Okay,so, uh, let's say it has, uh, 2020 some 400 pixels here. Okay, Le, let's assume that this is a small part of this entire image and then flattening it and then putting it into one MLP. Okay, then I'm scanning across all this, uh, this entire image and looking for occurrence of zero.So what is the output of this? MLP would be, uh, probability distribution between 0 to, uh 1 which says that if it has detected zero or not. So if it thinks that the image which was cast into this MLP contains a zero, it will have a very high probability, otherwise very low probability.", 'start_time': '00:13:37', 'end_time': '00:15:29'}, {'Topic': 'Robustness in Neural Networks', 'transcript': "Okay, so I'm just scanning this entire image, using my MLP who look for the zero. Okay. So once I have scanned the entire image. And if I see if at any place there was a high output from a model, then I would say, Okay, I have found a zero. So in this way. So this is the idea that by scanning, we can, uh, actually, uh, use some kind of, uh, introduce some kind of special robustness. So, uh, relevant of this, uh, space where? Irrelevant of location.In this image where the zero occurs by scanning, we are able to identify if it's present or not. Okay, so this was a key idea that so we will just take, uh, this idea forward and modified, and, uh, let's see how growth. So", 'start_time': '00:15:29', 'end_time': '00:16:22'}, {'Topic': 'CNN Hyperparameters', 'transcript': "one question there, uh, you were showing this. Oh, is that a kind of an or gate or kind of order of the outputs from here? What is, uh,yes? So basically, uh, I'm saying the highest of the highest for all these. Let's say this is, uh, the probability of finding a 00.10 0.01 and sometimes they'd say, Okay, I have very high probability of occurrence of zero. So I take the maximum of all these and then say Okay,I have found So zero Harris means means that I have found that the zero. Okay, so that's confusing. That, uhthat's good. So it was probably in the mind of the students, so I just thought I'd cheque. So it's a maximum that you're taking That takes the maximum. Yes.So this is where we have? Yeah, Yeah, for me. It's like 740. It's okay, but for seven, if we scan some part of seven and we could get one, right?Yeah, that's a valid problem. Uh, for that, uh, what we can do is we could we could add additional features. So that, uh, one so we can search for specific features, often digit digit. So let's say,uh, we could Instead of searching for the entire digit, we could search for some parts of it. So let's say if I have a feature like this, then maybe it's, uh indicates the presence of zero. Okay. And if I say that, Okay, there are four features which looks like this. They are coming in an image, so I can say, Okay, these are very close to zero, so you can just break that down into small features instead of taking into account the entire dignity.So what we're doing is we're hierarchically building this storey. So even another question that you should be asking at this point is that, uh, has chosen a box size that stores all of zero in it. Right? So also, he's shifting the scan that's taking place. He's shifting that, uh, square box in this exampleby a certain amount. Right. So if you are shifting by a certain amount, you might get part of the digit. Uh, and in fact, the square maybe too small to include the full digits. Right. So these are all questions that should be in your mind right now. Uh, now, the whole idea here is that we don't have to have one layer of, uhuh, somebody who needs to mute here. Uh, okay, So the idea here is that what has shown as a set of multi layer perceptron that are working on a small set of pixels in the neighbourhood,those are then being built upon by a second layer right, which is incorporating what are the features that have been seen in the previous player? So you're stacking up these features one on top of the other that are all essentially learning partial features to start with, and then more complete features, which then finally can lead to your classification. Does that make sense? The person who asked the questionwho asked the question. Yes. Okay, so this is just building on on what you know right now, which is a multi level perception, right?Yeah, go on. Sorry. Thank you. So, uh, mhm. So the idea here is that while scanning this entire image, the MLP is saying we are using the same MLB. We're not changing its weight, so this is very important. So this is called wait sharing him here. So we are sharing the weights. We're not introducing new weights at every, uh, box here,so which helps in reducing the A total number of parameters. We will study this, uh, detailing for the slides.", 'start_time': '00:16:22', 'end_time': '00:20:39'}, {'Topic': 'Weight Sharing in CNNs', 'transcript': "So the key idea is that any any layer in MLP there's only one thing which is taking the weighted sum of inputs and applying a non linearity. So you must have you must be very familiar with this, uh, expression that output off any layer is basically a weighted sum of, uhuh, inputs to the input stood from previous layer and the weight. Right. So you're just basically Sundays and put some activation function. Might be sick model any any kind of non linearity. So in this scanning approach, we are also doing the same thing. We're just taking a small part of the bigger image using, uh, those inputs, flattening them out, multiplying them with some weights and just putting some activation over it.Okay, so So this is an example where I am building the hierarchy. So as Selves are just explained that we are building hierarchy. So here you can see that output of this, uh, from this box. So the first box in this cream colour. So this output would go here in the next,uh, and output from this second box, which is shifted slightly. It would be just a decent road here. So by doing this, you're just building a compact representation of this image here.Okay, So this is one level of hierarchy. You could add another level. So you're just building over these hierarchies. So you're just learning some small features. And then, uh, on those small features, you're learning some more complex features using their combination.", 'start_time': '00:20:40', 'end_time': '00:22:18'}, {'Topic': 'Convolution and Feature Maps', 'transcript': "Okay, so you just, uh, scan. So these are the hair are different. New MLPs here. So this this MLP has, uh, one set of age. This is a new MLP. Here we are, scanning through it, okay. And then we have the final classification will happen. And so now we have sequentially added layers in one direction. We could also add, uh, complexity in the depth of it.So let's say you could have, uh, multiple different MLPs to scan on the first image itself. Earlier, I took an example of where MLP was detecting the zero.zero so you could have another MLP detects budget one another MLP for 32 for that kind of thing. And then you just basically build upon their features as well. So there is one head on. So you think. Think of this as a cube.right. And so, finally, you just can't get it. All of the features and you have a final classification.So this is how the idea of hair are key is taken into account from that horrible and visual experiment that we just build upon small features of the offer input and use those to classify, uh, actual image.", 'start_time': '00:22:19', 'end_time': '00:23:42'}, {'Topic': 'Pooling Techniques', 'transcript': "Okay, so that's that's great. Let's just make sure that everybody is following this. Right. So, uh, guys, what? What do you think? Here are some of the hyper parameters.in what has been discussed up until now. What do you think are the hyper parameters? Remember, the hyper parametersare defined when we, uh, you know, kind of, uh, they're not the model parameters. The weights that are connecting one layer input layer into the next hidden layer we're talking about hyper parameters is the definition ofthe architecture and other parameters that define that architecture. Right? So, for example, in linear regressionwhere we are using, uh, you know, say some regularisation. The regularisation constant is a hyper parameter, and the step size is a hyper parameter, right? We're still going to use gradient descent to learn the weights,but we, uh are defining. Uh, you know, uh, some other aspects of the network, right? So clearly step sizes. One hyper parameter here in a multilayered perceptron. What are the hyper parameters? It's the number of hidden nodes.and the number of hidden layers, right? Those are important hyper parameters. So what do you think are the hyper parameters here?maybe the ship. The shift. Science. Okay, so one of them is the shift size. That's good. what else? sorry.Philtre sides. So by philtre you're referring to the size of the square that we are shifting. Right, So good. Okay.What else? Number of philtres. Number of Philtres, Okay. a number of hidden layers. So what are we showing here? What is this,uh, diagram showing you each of these layers that you're seeing here? Uh, you know, so that we've got this image, the input image,right? And from each of the input images where we are creating one of these blue, uh, kind of compact representations, each of those blue compact representations aredifferent Philtres, right? So, as as government said in in one set of Philtres, you may be looking for horizontal lines in others, you may be looking at vertical lines, others you might be looking at, you know, uh,lines that are, in some way curved. Right? So you're looking for all of these different types of features. So when we talk about philtres, another way of thinking of these philtres these philtres comes from image processing,right where humans used to handcraft these philtres to extract features like edges and so on. Think of them as features that are being extracted, right? And so what you're now saying is you're getting this smaller sized image, which is the compaction. And then, as government has drawn these lines across these, uh, compact representations you're saying There are different features that are extracted from the same set of small number of.all located pixels, right? So philtre is nothing other than an M by N box right that defines which philtres are which pixels are connected to each other.in that MLP. So earlier, the multi layer Perceptron be flattened out the whole image. Now we only flattening out a small piece, which is this m by N box, which we're calling peopleright? And that's getting flattened and it can have a multilayered perceptron that finally gives an output. Now we're actually using a very simple multi layer perceptron here.which is essentially just got an input and an output layer. The output layers out, putting, like you said,a non linear transformation of the weighted sum of the parts. But remember that we are looking for the same feature with this, uh, N box, right? And so as we scan across, we are not needing to change the way. It's because the weights define which feature we're extracting, whether it's a vertical line or a horizontal line at the simplest right, so we don't need to change the weights, and that's why we're doing we're sharing.okay. And then, similarly from the same set of pixels, we may want to have another feature extracted. So we are now got a new set of features and we're extracting that. The other thing to remember is right now is only talking about black and white image grayscale image.If we had a colour image, then we would actually the spirit er would not be an M by N. box. It would actually be a three dimensional box right where the third dimensionis three. So it's a M by n by three or the image that is a colour image which has got the red, green and blue.channels. right. So one way of visualising this you've got an image of some size. You are reducing the size of the image by doing the scanningright. And with every feature that you're creating is like another channel. Right? So we went from RGB Channel to another description of the same data which has a smaller X and Y axis as such of the image. But it has a depth to it, which is the number of features that have been extracted. Right. And this is a very common feature that you will see when you book shows you the more complicated structures of a CNN.You'll find that you start off with a large image with three channels and you end up with very small images, but with lots of features, lots of channels with it.Right. So this is a very, very important thing to remember when you're doing CNN's, because later on, you will see some very interesting uses of the same philtre to reduce dimensionality.", 'start_time': '00:23:44', 'end_time': '00:31:01'}, {'Topic': 'Normalization of Inputs', 'transcript': "Okay, so do you understand all of these concepts? the shift size. you can see that the boxes are overlapping over each other, right? And so you can have a shiftof one pixel or two pixels or whatever. So that becomes a hyper parameter. Like you said, the philtre size definitely the size of the box, the number of philtres at each layer that you're definingright, and the number of such hidden layers that are transforming the input into a smaller, more compact representation.Right is another type of parameters. So very good. And what is the shift called? What is the technical term for shift?stride. Okay, great. Excellent. Okay. Good luck. Any questions on this before it goes on? Because things will only get more complex as we go on.Okay, Wonderful. Okay, So this is the example of, uh, typical Syrian architecture. This is called the Leonard five, which was developed by young liquid.Okay, so here we can see that, uh, this is, uh, example of the box. We were talking earlier. And by scanning this, uh, moving this box across this image. So we end up with several feature maps, you can see.So let's, uh let's start moving towards, uh, terminology. So these are called the future maps here. Okay. And so let's say we have six philtres of such types. This is one philtre, so if you have six philtresThen you will have six feature maps for each philtre because one feature because one philtre will scan the entire image.So we'll have one future map similarly for six philtre six philtres. You have six feature maps. Okay. And then there is a layer called sub sampling. So where you just, uh, take the max? Uh, just sample down. So, uh, one of the most common, uh, sub sampling technique is called Max pooling. So what they do here is they take two by two, sample out of this feature map and say this has value one. This is 263, and this is forso they take the maximum out of it and say so. This, uh, two by two matrix has four as the maximum value. So for the next, uh, through the next feature map, the four will be representing one pixel here instead of four pixels.", 'start_time': '00:31:02', 'end_time': '00:33:52'}, {'Topic': 'Advanced Convolution Techniques', 'transcript': "Okay, So this is basically how we sub samples. So we are just if it has 2828 dimensions, then the output will have 14 by 14 dimensions by using this, uh, two by two Max schooling.Okay, so this is called sub sampling, and then we have another conclusion. Blog, another sub sampling layer, and then we have a fully connected layer. So this is the layer which actually does the classification into 10 outputs for administrator. They will pretend for any other data. There would be different number of classes Where, uh, where we want to classify our input image to be.uh, is this clear? So we will understand all these terms, uh, in the next slaves. So this is the typical architecture. So every architecture of the CNN has some, uh, modification of it,okay. When you are saying that there are six feature maps, you're basically talking about the third dimension, which is the under six channelsthat are being created. Yes. So here. You could say this is a volume which have six dimensions. Six depth. 28 is the time. 20 at theheight. And are you going to walk through how they get from 32 by 32 28 20 years? Yes. Okay. Thank you.okay? Okay, So there was one thing I want to visualise here. Yeah, so? So this is a typical grayscale image. So this is the original image you can see here. And this is just a zoom in version, so you can see that every pixel has a value from 0 to 2. 56 to 55. Sorry.So you can see, uh, the white pixel here it has value of 2. 55. Is the number eligible on the left hand side?okay. And for a black pixel, let's say, down here, the value is, uh, close to zero. Okay, so, uh, this is the representation of grayscale image, soSo now I just wanted to visualise that how this future would work. So here we have. uh, let's on the left hand side. You have this, uh, three by three matrix. Right? So what we're doing here is just, uh here in the centre, you have a philtre by three by three philtre So the it's called sharpen philtre. And it has, uh, these values. So what we are doing here is that just taking the value for each box in this red metricsand just doing an element wise multiplication with this, uh, sharp and philtre. And the output is represented here in the right hand side. So, for example,uh, let's take something near the so you can see here. Uh, the left, the left, and the first element in this, uh,read matrix is 103. You can see it here. right. So you're multiplying it with zero and then 128 with minus one and so on and so forth. And the output of this entire operation is just a single value, which is minus 157. You can see it in the middle, and this is represented here.uh, one pixel value in the right image. Okay, so this is basically the process of applying any philtre here.So, uh, we've got an answer. Which is minus 157. Yes. Uh, be clipped to zero. It will be close to zero.okay. And so you can see here that while working with the edges here so there won't be three values available.Right? So that's why the right image is padded with black border. That's all zeros it contains okay? So, uh, the key idea here is that these features these these philtres basically give rise to different feature maps. So this, this is called sharp and philtre.There is another thing called blur Philtre. So what does this basically takes the, uh, centre value of, uh, this red metricsand just adds, uh, surrounding pixel values basically smooth out the entire image so you can see that, uh, the multiplication happening and the images looks a bit blurry or, you could say, smoothed out image.Okay. So the idea to understand here is that we can have different types of these features. Sorry. Philtres there is called right, Sobel.So you can say it's kind. It's, uh, edges. It will. This is the right Sobel philtre. You can see the values are changing. So there is a left Sobel which detects different orientation of hedges. There is, uh,top Sobel, which identifies different orientations of the edges. So basically, everything is dependent on this philtre. So these are basically featured maps.", 'start_time': '00:33:54', 'end_time': '00:39:45'}, {'Topic': 'Feature Extraction in CNNs', 'transcript': "Okay, so now that we have some visual understanding of how philtre looks and what and this is this is how the future maps would look.Okay, so there is another example of this image. So this is the original image. Okay, Now, if I apply, sharpen, uh around it, you can see it's got a bit sharp.And if you you stop symbol on it, it detects, uh, like horizontal edges. If I apply right Sobel, it detects vertical edges so on and so forth.is this clear? Yes, sir. Okay. so these weights are okay, So, uh, which no one is asking a question here. Uh, how? Well, normalising the pixel values affect the neural network.Um, so we should make sure you don't send it privately because those questions come to me, Uh, is not able to see it, but I've explained this, right? So when you talk about normalising the pixel values, what are you referring to? What you're talking about theapplication of these philtres. a new a new mutants piece. so, like dividing each pixel value by 2. 55.Okay, so that is really bringing the scale down to become from 0 to 1, right? Is that what you're? Okay, So what you're saying is, how does the normalisation of pixel values affect the neural network?a good book. Do you want to take this socialite? Uh, so please go ahead. Okay. So essentially, visual, what happens with the neural network when your input layer, uh, is essentially got very differing skills, right for each of the teachers. Then what is happening to the cost function that you're trying to minimise this that is stretched in certain directions and squeezed in other directions.Right. So whenever you actually calculate the gradient, you start kind of bouncing between points and don't move necessarily in the direction that gives you the, uh, which leads you directly to the ideal, uh, solution. Right? So what happens when you scale or normalise the numbers, All of the skills of all of the inputs? What ends up happening is that you get a much more rounder shift,uh, cost function, and so you will actually start to now the first known more directly towards the minimum,", 'start_time': '00:39:45', 'end_time': '00:42:36'}, {'Topic': 'Mathematics of Convolution', 'transcript': "so it speeds up the minimisation of the past. That's the advantage of doing this normalisation okay? right. Anybody else have any questions around the application of the philtres themselves?are you making the Connexion between the fact that these philtres that are being played with up here, the colonel's as they're being referred to here, are essentially handcrafted Wales. Right? So you only have seven or eight philtres here.that are shown where the minus 101 minus 20 to minus 101 is one set of weights that have been handcrafted.Now, if you think about what a multilayered Perceptron is doing, it's actually learning these. It's learning these weights,right? So rather than us having to humanly created this, um, these philtres that we then know what kind of feature is going to be extracted by them by each application of the philtre throughout the image. What we are saying is we can actually now with neural networks, learn the weights, which will extract features that humans may not be able to interpret.but the neural network finds them useful. because they have been able to minimise the cost function as it is.", 'start_time': '00:42:36', 'end_time': '00:44:10'}, {'Topic': 'Convolution vs Cross-Correlation', 'transcript': "does that make sense? so we are automatically extracting features that humans may not understand. right through each of these applications.

So after, uh, sliding this philtre on the original image we get this is everything in This is the output of the free to map. This is the sharpen philtre. This is the blur philtre.

The white is now here on the above.Okay, so the idea behind conclusion is that if you just, uh, flip your philtre by 12 degrees and then blue cross correlation.

So the basic idea is that we are going to use this cross correlation and conclusion to find the mathematical expressions for back propagation, so it will come hand in later.okay.

If you just try to write these expressions down and you will be able to figure out that we're just recreating the philtreand doing the cross correlation, okay? Okay, so So till now we discuss these handcrafted philtres like the blur sharpen, agitation, etcetera. But these are the things which the model learns as just described. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna visualise these features for the religion. It Okay, Uh, so let me first explain that how these, uhhow these architectures look like. Okay, so, uh, the input here is, uh, before we go into the architecture, can we just, uh, do a little bit of discussion around how the philtre size impact, the output image size, But is that coming after this?Yes. I was just trying to bring Troy. I don't have, uh Okay. Okay. So let's say religion yet We use colour images, so let's say it will be a three dimensional image.And let's say it is 2. 56 by 2. 56 with three channels of input. Okay, so now we want to, uh, involved used 32 philtres here.Okay of dimensions, Uh, three by three. Okay, So this is how you generally defining your chaos or you're open source, uh, libraries, but under the hood. Uh, what is happening is that each philtre will have dimensionsthree by three. And this three, the depth is coming from the input. because the input image has three channels as death. So you're each philtre will also have a depth of three. Okay, so what we do here is that we take small, uh,crop of size three by three hair from this bigger image. three by three by three And we just, uh, do an element wise multiplication of all these elements in this cubewith this philtre. Okay, So if there are, let's say, uh, three numbers here and three numbers in the first, uh, slice. Then you just, uh, do the cross correlation, and there would be one output.Okay. And you do same for all the layers. So for second slice here also, okay, and output of this result would be single number.this is very important to note. Okay, so after conclusion where there will be one value here. So you do this for across entire this image. So you have access right of one.so let's let's leave it to them to come up with the answer. Okay, So with the stride of one pixel means that you're shifting by one pixel to the right all the way till you get to the end of the image, right? So recognise that you get to the end of the image when the right side of your philtre reaches the edge. Okay, so there's no paddingfor those of you know what padding is. There's no padding. For those of you who don't know about padding, just don't worry about it. Just tell us what is going to be the size of the image that comes out on the other side when we do the scanning. Now the stride works left to rightand talk to bottom. right. So as you scan across, you're going one pixel at a time and going to the next position where the philtre is applied. And then when you get to the end, you shift the philtre down by one,uh, pixel and apply it again. Correct? Yes, sir. Okay. So what is going to be the size of the image that is coming out on the other end? Or the the two dimensional array that's coming out at the end? Because remember what is sayingthat the three by three by three is producing only one number, so the multilayered Perceptron is taking27 inputs and is out putting one value. Okay, So what you're getting as a result of applying this philtre is a two dimensionalmatrix of numbers, and I want to know the dimensionality of that. 54. other ways, okay? there were two people speaking. So one person said to 54.And what was the other person saying? I think, uh, zero comma zero is concerned at the centre, and, uh, the other things are taken at that size in the same way you look at work,right? So, like I said, the we are resuming zero padding go padding right now. Right? So your philtre starts from the edge and takes the first three into account.right, and then it moves by one and moves by one. Right? So the size is going to be there. One answer that's been given us 254.Is that the number of rows or the number of columns, or what is to 54? I think both. Okay, Anybody else have a different answer?no sort of 54 and 54 in total Tito. in 2. 32. Okay, 32 because we've got 32 philtres. Good. Okay. I have been looking for one philtre with Excellent. Okay, so 254 by 2. 50 for 5. 32 will be the third dimension.Uh, just for this philtre Yes, output will be just a matrix. Uh, considering for just one philtre, this is just one,Uh, that's correct that we will have 32 such philtres. So for each of that philtre, we will have one,to the output. Yes. Yes. And then that will build up to 30 to do that. Yeah. Perfect. Perfect. Okay, So what happens now if we make the stride?Ooh! Okay, so now let's make the strive to what becomes the output size now? Does the output size change?instead. How much does it change? Uh, third dimension in the same 1. 27 1 27 127. So how did you come up with 1. 27?sir. And if you take in putting measures in and the philtres. I just Yes. And we We are taking a straight to that isminus Yes. And we are adding one to the and mine the eff s blossom. Okay. Do you want to write the formula they're given? You've got access toYes, Uh, like the formula, which, uh Okay, can you please repeat and I say important measure that is 256 in 2016 and a filtered site.and at that stage. the farm law of the output. The message will be and minus f s plus one. listen. so that would be a 56 minus.three dots. Bye. HM. That doesn't seems correct. It's two less 127. So now you've got 253 divided by two, right?So what happens? We've got a decimal number there. So I have that too. From the looks. you will take in digital partnership.If we have fraction, then we protect right? so Yeah. So that is the same formula. Uh, only were riding fighting out here. Right? Fighting is zero w minus scale over this. That's whywhich is fine. And then what you're saying is we are taking the interior part. So are we rounding up or are we rounding down?so if there is greater than five, then we are all being up. but now it's point. What do we do? I think running, don't you?Okay, so let's just take a small example of, uh, seven by seven image, right? and what is happening here when we are not doing a padding, So the first one is three by three.the philtre application. And then we're taking a stride of two, which means now we're starting from pixel, too.23. And, uh, so we're starting the numbering from zero. Right, So 0 to 6 is the pixel numbering. Okay,Right. And now we're doing a three by three. right. So the three by three the first philtre, then we're taking a stride of two.so we start from now 23 and four. And now we take another stride of two, which gives us now. four, five and six.", 'start_time': '00:55:18', 'end_time': '01:06:58'}, {'Topic': 'Parameter Learning in CNNs', 'transcript': "right. So in this case, if we look at the formula, what's happening is N is seven minus three. great.stride is too so seven minus 3/2. which is three, right? So that's 4/2. That's 13, so we can see we have created three. Now the problem comes when we have an eight by eight image, right? And now we have an issue in that if we had another pixels in rows and columns.we basically not be able to do any further, right? So if we had an eight by eight image, if you can just draw that additional problem and go.Now, when we go for the stride of two, we are going over the edge, so we can't do anymore, right? So we are always looking at the number below, as the output were basically ignoring the that last follow. And that last room. Right? So we will always take the lower number out here.right. okay?

Iwant the same number of notes as I have in the hidden layer in the CNN. So how many notes do I have in the hidden layer in the CNN?trick questions. mhm. 56. Close to 56. Crusty.

I think hopefully everybody's got anybody. Got a question here? I know there are a few of you who have dealt with CNN's and done some deep learning. That does not mean that people who are not understanding this can't ask questions.Okay, So for those of you who are new to this, this is very, very important that you understand this.

Okay, So next, uh, was trying to visualise these features. So? So what we have here is so he worked with it was that we took an RGB image.and used 32 philtres to create 32 future maps. Okay, so what we're basically doing is we are just, uh, cross finding the cross correlation of each of this philtre with entire image. So as we, uh, looked earlier, uh, visual representation of cross correlation. So I just wanted to visualise that what these 32 philtres look like. Okay, SoI'm going to show you that how they look like, So I'm using really 16 for that. That's an architecture. It's a CNN architecture, very common.So it has taken, uh, RGB images of size 24 by 24. And so these are, uh this is the basic basic architecture. So it has to conclusion blockseach using 64 philtres. It then has a max full, then to conclusion blocks of 128. uh, philtres each again for school and then three conclusions by, uh, containing 2. 56 philtres and so on. You can see here and then we have a fully connected layer. Uh, the final layer, which classifies each imagine 2000 categories.This is the basic architecture of this video. 16. So, what we're trying to do here that in each conclusion lock so you can see there are 60 for future maps. We will just see how the 16th of future maps look like.So there are 1 28 ft high maps. We will look at each of them. Okay. So for the sake of convenience, I am only displaying features for these four or five players. The first, the very first conclusion there. The fourth player. 7, 1114. Okay, so let's just have a look at them.So this is, uh, first, uh, output of the conclusion block. Okay, so in what is this image of a house? Okay. And, uh, there are three, philtres of this dimension three by three by three.right. So after, uh, cross correlation of one philtre with the entire image, we get one feature map like this.Okay. For 60 for Philtres, 50 for such 60. For such philtres, we have 64 future maps, so you can see that each of the philtre is, uh,trying to highlight some specific features. So if you see here, this philtre is highlighting grass here.uh, this philtre here is highlighting the pillars. Or you could say the vertical edges. Okay. And, uhthis philtre here is highlighting the door so you can see each philtre is, uh, targeting some features.All right, so next I'm moving on to the fourth layer. So this was the layer of confusion blocks having 128 philtres.Okay, so I'm not showing all of the 128 philtres just because it gets very messy. So these are just 60 for philtres out of this 1. 28 here. So you can see, uh, compared from this is compared from the first congressional put, this one has become a little bit more detailed or abstract. You could say there is a lot more detail. There is a lot more textual information here.Some, uh, very dark. Some are highlighting several features. Okay, this is the fourth layer next, moving on to the seventh layer so you can see, uh, things are getting more abstract here. It's difficult to describe what features. Uh, CNN is learning,but we can see that something different is happening with each feature map. So there is a definition of house here, but in here, we have totally lost it. Maybe this this philtre would was looking for something else. which is not present in this feature in this image,maybe something like that. Okay, so now we have reached 11th layer. It has, I think, 2. 56 philtres and I'm displaying only 64 corresponding feature maps out of these two physics. Okay, No, things have become more abstract. And then, you know, 15th layer,uh, things become even more abstract. You could see that that some freedom maps are, uh, not saying anything at all. For example, there's there's only slight activation here, but for some philtres, there are a lot of evacuations happening.and in 17 player. So this has, uh, 512 feature maps and displaying only 64. You could see that only some some part of theafter the conclusion. Output has some information in it. Rest everything is just shut down. Okay, so let me just go through that again. So this is the first congressional put second. So ifeverybody realising that each of these small images is one layer now in that output right in this, so I shouldn't say one layer one feature, right? So one channel within the fourth layer. So everybody using, uh, you know, onepretty good right to generate each of these small images here, Right? And we're seeing What is it that it is learning from this image? And of course, this is the house. And, like, uh, was saying the V G architecture has been developed to learn 1000 different classes, right? So for different classes of images, you'll have different features, uh, getting highlighted right. And as we go throughright now, we are identifying edges and some relationships between those edges. But we're basically as we go, deeper and deeper,it actually becomes much more abstract, but is useful finally to make a classification that this is a house as opposed to an elephantright. Okay. Carry on group. Yeah. So this was the output of first conclusion block. 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th. And finally, we could use this output for classification. So basically, what we have done here is that we took an image and we extracted features out of that,and to some to that extent, that we are able to build a classified over it. That when we have an image of in house, we could say some features get activated if we have, uh, image of human that several different features get activated, and then we can use these activations to basically just classify or input dimension.Right. So here have how blood cells are. Okay, So the first output you could see here is that, uh, several feature maps are looking at the skin. Some are looking at beard. Some are looking at this the turbo and some are looking at the edges. So this is this little These feature maps would work for any human rights.On the second conclusion output, you could see things become more abstract. Then in third National Boardfort, you can see that this, uh, these features around here, they somehow represent I guess that human face that eyes and mouth Maybe that's my guess. I'm not sure.And again, in the just the final conclusion block things become very extracted. Only few future master activity dressed are just shut down.So here we have, uh, to human faces in the image so you could see in the final layer. So I'm showing, uh, all the 512 accusations here in the final conclusion block. So you could see, uh, things which are highlighted here in yellow.So similar features have been activated here. If you take a look at these two, these two here, and these two here, they look pretty similar.So we expect that any human, uh, face would excite these, uh, future maps of this, uh, Jeanette. And then later we can use this information, uh, to just classify that which category an image belongs to.Remember that the objective here is not to discriminate and identify between Luke and myself. Here. This is actually just to classify it into, uh, face versus house.Yes. So here we have a face versus house, so you can see that, uh, these are the features activated and different set of features activated in the final constitution outputso you can see they are not in this In this area, these we can have some not activity. any questions on this.Okay, Uh, we are at the end of the lecture, so I think Is this a good place to stop? Yes. Great. Excellent. Okay. So thank you so much for this. I think that's been wonderful. Uh, folks, uh, carry on with CNN's in on Saturday, so if there are no questions now, we'll end this session.Okay. No questions. So I'm ending the session. Thank you. Thanks, everyone.

The lecture highlights the versatility of CNNs beyond image tasks, touching on insect detection, plant disease identification, and natural language processing.\n\nKey topics include the architecture of CNNs, historical development from early models like the neocognitron and LeNet-5, and the importance of spatial invariance and maintaining spatial information during image processing. The discussion examines the mathematical aspects of convolution, cross-correlation, and the function of filters, which extract hierarchical features from images. It emphasizes the significance of weight sharing in reducing model parameters and improving efficiency.\n\nPooling techniques, normalization of inputs, and hyperparameter settings are explored, with a focus on filters' roles in feature extraction and the impact of stride and padding on output dimensions. The session also addresses the robustness of models to spatial variations, the calculation of parameters, and the comparison between CNNs and traditional multilayer perceptrons in terms of efficiency. The final remarks highlight the progressive complexity of features through layers and the visualization of these features, culminating in applications for image classification."}

And you just fit a simple multi layer perceptron into it and classify each input into one of the 10 classes.So this is the typical, uh, workflow for amnesty, and we are easily able to achieve 95 maybe 98% accuracy on the state of using very simple Uh, okay,So a typical output for for the last level look something like this.

And it has, uh, these values. So what we are doing here is that just taking the value for each box in this red metricsand just doing an element wise multiplication with this, uh, sharp and philtre. And the output is represented here in the right hand side. So, for example,read matrix is 103. You can see it here. right. So you're multiplying it with zero and then 128 with minus one and so on and so forth. And the output of this entire operation is just a single value, which is minus 157.

So what does this basically takes the, uh, centre value of, uh, this red metricsand just adds, uh, surrounding pixel values basically smooth out the entire image so you can see that, uh, the multiplication happening and the images looks a bit blurry or, you could say, smoothed out image.Okay. So the idea to understand here is that we can have different types of these features. Sorry. Philtres there is called right, Sobel.So you can say it's kind. It's, uh, edges. It will. This is the right Sobel philtre. You can see the values are changing. So there is a left Sobel which detects different orientation of hedges.

And since 1950 there's a lot of research going on. So one of the study done by Hubble and Weasel was, uh, they took a catOkay, So these experiments basically set the stage for, uh, some outstanding research for the next 20 years and building on these ideas in 1986. Uh, there was, uh, scientists called Fukushima, so he built something called neo cabinet trump.And it was the state of the art at its time. But some people said that due to, uh, computational limitations, they were not able to take it to the next close. Okay. And in the 19 nineties, building on these ideas, uh, so he was able to create first successful, uh, conclusion neural network. And it was called Lane at five. So it was the first successful demonstration for character recognition,uh, without, like, frightening damage. So we will discuss about this.

So And they have one digit from 0 to 9 representing in that image.uh, Dimension vector. And you just fit a simple multi layer perceptron into it and classify each input into one of the 10 classes.So this is the typical, uh, workflow for amnesty, and we are easily able to achieve 95 maybe 98% accuracy on the state of using very simple Uh, okay,So a typical output for for the last level look something like this. So this is a 10 dimensions input output. So this is the zero index, and this is the ninth index. So, uh, each the index. Basically, it tells you what is the budget on this image. So for this in 49 you can see the ninth, uh, value in this output. Uh, this is basically a probability distribution.Similarly, for three, you can see the third index has, uh, like a perfect one probability for being three. And similarly, for two, you have this. So what I did was simply I just, uh,changed the input to the, uh, neural network, which was trained on this administrator. So I just shrink the images slightly and, uh, changed the position where the budgets were so earlier. It was just sent in central incentive, but now I am putting these digits on the sideways, and they are slightly smaller than earlier So what happened immediately was that the predictions were very messed up.So the model thinks that this budget is 012345. So the model think it's five, but it's actually zero. So you see that, uh, only with a slide shift of the image, the model's performance has reduced drastically. Similarly, for six, the model thinks it is 0123456.uh sure. Uh Yeah. So the model thinks 87. Okay, but, uh, So the key idea here is that the predictions got messed up similarly with one hair. So we would expect this to be the outfit of your model, but model was predicting this. So there is some error. So we need to make which is robust to these, uh, these kinds of variations,okay. So the key idea. So the key findings from about exercise for where that model does not generalise. Well, okay, so we need a model which have some degree of spatial invariance so we could have translation invariance.Okay, if we shift the digits slightly, the model's performance should not be, uh, affected drastically. So some amount of rotation should also be taken into account,right? And some amount of side invariants elimination invariants all these kinds of things should be taken into account.

Uh, okay, So the idea here is that what has shown as a set of multi layer perceptron that are working on a small set of pixels in the neighbourhood,Yeah, go on. Sorry. Thank you. So, uh, mhm. So the idea here is that while scanning this entire image, the MLP is saying we are using the same MLB. We're not changing its weight, so this is very important.

The weights that are connecting one layer input layer into the next hidden layer we're talking about hyper parameters is the definition ofbut we, uh are defining. Uh, you know, uh, some other aspects of the network, right? So clearly step sizes. One hyper parameter here in a multilayered perceptron. What are the hyper parameters? It's the number of hidden nodes.and the number of hidden layers, right? Those are important hyper parameters. So what do you think are the hyper parameters here?maybe the ship. The shift. Science. Okay, so one of them is the shift size. That's good. what else? sorry.Philtre sides. So by philtre you're referring to the size of the square that we are shifting. Right, So good. Okay.What else? Number of philtres. Number of Philtres, Okay. a number of hidden layers. So what are we showing here? What is this,", 'start_time': '00:23:44', 'end_time': '00:26:04'}, {'Topic': 'Feature Maps and Filter Operations', 'transcript': "Okay, so here we can see that, uh, this is, uh, example of the box. We were talking earlier. And by scanning this, uh, moving this box across this image. So we end up with several feature maps, you can see.So let's, uh let's start moving towards, uh, terminology. So these are called the future maps here. Okay. And so let's say we have six philtres of such types. This is one philtre, so if you have six philtresSo we'll have one future map similarly for six philtre six philtres. You have six feature maps. Okay. And then there is a layer called sub sampling. So where you just, uh, take the max? Uh, just sample down. So, uh, one of the most common, uh, sub sampling technique is called Max pooling. So what they do here is they take two by two, sample out of this feature map and say this has value one. This is 263, and this is forOkay, So this is basically how we sub samples. So we are just if it has 2828 dimensions, then the output will have 14 by 14 dimensions by using this, uh, two by two Max schooling.Okay, so this is called sub sampling, and then we have another conclusion. Blog, another sub sampling layer, and then we have a fully connected layer. So this is the layer which actually does the classification into 10 outputs for administrator. They will pretend for any other data. There would be different number of classes Where, uh, where we want to classify our input image to be.uh, is this clear? So we will understand all these terms, uh, in the next slaves. So this is the typical architecture. So every architecture of the CNN has some, uh, modification of it,okay. When you are saying that there are six feature maps, you're basically talking about the third dimension, which is the under six channelsSo you can see, uh, the white pixel here it has value of 2. 55. Is the number eligible on the left hand side?okay. And for a black pixel, let's say, down here, the value is, uh, close to zero. Okay, so, uh, this is the representation of grayscale image, soSo now I just wanted to visualise that how this future would work. So here we have. uh, let's on the left hand side. You have this, uh, three by three matrix. Right? So what we're doing here is just, uh here in the centre, you have a philtre by three by three philtre So the it's called sharpen philtre. And it has, uh, these values. So what we are doing here is that just taking the value for each box in this red metricsand just doing an element wise multiplication with this, uh, sharp and philtre. And the output is represented here in the right hand side. So, for example,read matrix is 103. You can see it here. right. So you're multiplying it with zero and then 128 with minus one and so on and so forth. And the output of this entire operation is just a single value, which is minus 157. You can see it in the middle, and this is represented here.uh, one pixel value in the right image. Okay, so this is basically the process of applying any philtre here.okay. And so you can see here that while working with the edges here so there won't be three values available.Right? So that's why the right image is padded with black border. That's all zeros it contains okay? So, uh, the key idea here is that these features these these philtres basically give rise to different feature maps. So this, this is called sharp and philtre.There is another thing called blur Philtre. So what does this basically takes the, uh, centre value of, uh, this red metricsand just adds, uh, surrounding pixel values basically smooth out the entire image so you can see that, uh, the multiplication happening and the images looks a bit blurry or, you could say, smoothed out image.Okay. So the idea to understand here is that we can have different types of these features. Sorry. Philtres there is called right, Sobel.So you can say it's kind. It's, uh, edges. It will. This is the right Sobel philtre. You can see the values are changing. So there is a left Sobel which detects different orientation of hedges. There is, uh,top Sobel, which identifies different orientations of the edges. So basically, everything is dependent on this philtre.

Little networks won't do it on images or several other kinds of data. So why do we need CNN? First, we'll discuss that and then some history regarding what work has been done regarding CNN's andThen we will see the basic building blocks and different layers which people have came across. Uh, and we will then discuss the back propagation CNN as, uh, you must have done in a mist, uh, using the, uh, shallow neural. Introducing the mystery does it.And then we will finally discuss, uh, some common architecture. Is CNN architectures and some way to regularise them or improve their performance.Okay, so, uh, I believe that you are very familiar with Mr Asset, so it basically consists, uh, black and white images, which are 28 by 2018 size. So And they have one digit from 0 to 9 representing in that image.So basically, a simple MLP for, uh would require you to flatten this image. So you flatten it out into a 287, 84 dimensional victor one by 74uh, Dimension vector. And you just fit a simple multi layer perceptron into it and classify each input into one of the 10 classes.So this is the typical, uh, workflow for amnesty, and we are easily able to achieve 95 maybe 98% accuracy on the state of using very simple Uh, okay,So a typical output for for the last level look something like this. So this is a 10 dimensions input output. So this is the zero index, and this is the ninth index. So, uh, each the index. Basically, it tells you what is the budget on this image. So for this in 49 you can see the ninth, uh, value in this output. Uh, this is basically a probability distribution.So the ninth area has the ninth value. Sorry. The 10th value, The last value has the value of 0.99. So the model is very confident that this image contains the ninth.Similarly, for three, you can see the third index has, uh, like a perfect one probability for being three. And similarly, for two, you have this. So what I did was simply I just, uh,changed the input to the, uh, neural network, which was trained on this administrator. So I just shrink the images slightly and, uh, changed the position where the budgets were so earlier. It was just sent in central incentive, but now I am putting these digits on the sideways, and they are slightly smaller than earlier So what happened immediately was that the predictions were very messed up.So the model thinks that this budget is 012345. So the model think it's five, but it's actually zero. So you see that, uh, only with a slide shift of the image, the model's performance has reduced drastically. Similarly, for six, the model thinks it is 0123456.uh sure. Uh Yeah. So the model thinks 87. Okay, but, uh, So the key idea here is that the predictions got messed up similarly with one hair. So we would expect this to be the outfit of your model, but model was predicting this. So there is some error. So we need to make which is robust to these, uh, these kinds of variations,okay. So the key idea. So the key findings from about exercise for where that model does not generalise. Well, okay, so we need a model which have some degree of spatial invariance so we could have translation invariance.Okay, if we shift the digits slightly, the model's performance should not be, uh, affected drastically.

And you just fit a simple multi layer perceptron into it and classify each input into one of the 10 classes.So this is the typical, uh, workflow for amnesty, and we are easily able to achieve 95 maybe 98% accuracy on the state of using very simple Uh, okay,So a typical output for for the last level look something like this. So this is a 10 dimensions input output. So this is the zero index, and this is the ninth index. So, uh, each the index. Basically, it tells you what is the budget on this image. So for this in 49 you can see the ninth, uh, value in this output. Uh, this is basically a probability distribution.So the ninth area has the ninth value. Sorry. The 10th value, The last value has the value of 0.99. So the model is very confident that this image contains the ninth.Similarly, for three, you can see the third index has, uh, like a perfect one probability for being three. And similarly, for two, you have this. So what I did was simply I just, uh,changed the input to the, uh, neural network, which was trained on this administrator. So I just shrink the images slightly and, uh, changed the position where the budgets were so earlier. It was just sent in central incentive, but now I am putting these digits on the sideways, and they are slightly smaller than earlier So what happened immediately was that the predictions were very messed up.So the model thinks that this budget is 012345. So the model think it's five, but it's actually zero. So you see that, uh, only with a slide shift of the image, the model's performance has reduced drastically. Similarly, for six, the model thinks it is 0123456.uh sure. Uh Yeah. So the model thinks 87. Okay, but, uh, So the key idea here is that the predictions got messed up similarly with one hair. So we would expect this to be the outfit of your model, but model was predicting this. So there is some error. So we need to make which is robust to these, uh, these kinds of variations,okay. So the key idea. So the key findings from about exercise for where that model does not generalise. Well, okay, so we need a model which have some degree of spatial invariance so we could have translation invariance.Okay, if we shift the digits slightly, the model's performance should not be, uh, affected drastically. So some amount of rotation should also be taken into account,right? And some amount of side invariants elimination invariants all these kinds of things should be taken into account. Okay, So I would just like you to just keep this in your mind. That what problem? Uh, what, uh, how would you solve this problem? What kind of architecture could you use?Okay. And the key idea is that by flattening the image, we lose the spatial information, which is very important. So we need to think some, uh, some other activity does not flatten the imageOkay. So again, here is an example of dog from different, uh, angles. They're different sizes, different angles of the storey.so coming to some history of CNN's. So this problem has been quite well known. And since 1950 there's a lot of research going on. So one of the study done by Hubble and Weasel was, uh, they took a catand, uh, gave the card anaesthesia, so they forcefully kept the eyes opened up the card in the separatist, as you can see here.and they flashed a stimulus in front of cat's eyes. And in turn, they measure the electrical impulse generated in the brain in the brain of the cat. So they put electrodes in the brain. And whenever they would show some stimulus, there would be some neurons that would get excited, and they recorded that electric impulse.So what they did was, uh, showed some edges, uh, to the cat, some edges of various orientation, somewhere moving so you could see this board. This man is flashing this boat in front of the cat's eyes and in turn, they are recording the impulse in the cat's brain.Okay, so this was the experiment done by them, uh, human and basil. And the key findings were that, uh, there are some cells which get activated, uh, by some small edges or moving edges.Okay. And some cells are often direction specific. They only get excited when some edges being shown to them, Huh? Which is sliding from a particular direction onlyand, uh, there are higher higher level of cells, uh, more complex cells, which are selected with the length of the moving edge. So these kinds of these features simply build up over each other. So this was the key findings from the experiment.Okay, So that, uh, without losing the spatial invariance, how could we without flattening them? And how could we use that? So they figured out that somehow you need to build some hierarchy into the model to preserve the spatial information.Okay, So these experiments basically set the stage for, uh, some outstanding research for the next 20 years and building on these ideas in 1986. Uh, there was, uh, scientists called Fukushima, so he built something called neo cabinet trump.So it's basically an architecture. It was an unsurprised, uh, machine learning based architecture, which used to which was used to, uh, recognise digits.And it was the state of the art at its time. But some people said that due to, uh, computational limitations, they were not able to take it to the next close. Okay. And in the 19 nineties, building on these ideas, uh, so he was able to create first successful, uh, conclusion neural network. And it was called Lane at five. So it was the first successful demonstration for character recognition,uh, without, like, frightening damage. So we will discuss about this. Architecture it in the spotlight.Okay, So now I would like to pause for a moment. And I want you all to think that how would you use this information To modify the existing neural network, which you have trained and administrators, uh, so that it is more robust to spatial invariance. Like how we approach this problem? Just think for a moment.Okay, So the solution would be to just stand for digits. Okay, so let's say, uh, this isn't modified image image, so I have just shrink the zero and, uh, introduced some translation variance. So what I'm doing here is that I took a simple MLP.You can call it, uh, zero director for now. It only detects if, uh, zero is present in some part of image or not. Okay, so, uh, what I'm doing here is I'm taking small part of the image and then flattening it. Okay,so, uh, let's say it has, uh, 2020 some 400 pixels here. Okay, Le, let's assume that this is a small part of this entire image and then flattening it and then putting it into one MLP. Okay, then I'm scanning across all this, uh, this entire image and looking for occurrence of zero.So what is the output of this? MLP would be, uh, probability distribution between 0 to, uh 1 which says that if it has detected zero or not. So if it thinks that the image which was cast into this MLP contains a zero, it will have a very high probability, otherwise very low probability.Okay, so I'm just scanning this entire image, using my MLP who look for the zero. Okay. So once I have scanned the entire image. And if I see if at any place there was a high output from a model, then I would say, Okay, I have found a zero. So in this way. So this is the idea that by scanning, we can, uh, actually, uh, use some kind of, uh, introduce some kind of special robustness. So, uh, relevant of this, uh, space where? Irrelevant of location.In this image where the zero occurs by scanning, we are able to identify if it's present or not. Okay, so this was a key idea that so we will just take, uh, this idea forward and modified, and, uh, let's see how growth. Soone question there, uh, you were showing this. Oh, is that a kind of an or gate or kind of order of the outputs from here? What is, uh,yes? So basically, uh, I'm saying the highest of the highest for all these. Let's say this is, uh, the probability of finding a 00.10 0.01 and sometimes they'd say, Okay, I have very high probability of occurrence of zero. So I take the maximum of all these and then say Okay,I have found So zero Harris means means that I have found that the zero. Okay, so that's confusing. That, uhthat's good. So it was probably in the mind of the students, so I just thought I'd cheque. So it's a maximum that you're taking That takes the maximum. Yes.So this is where we have? Yeah, Yeah, for me. It's like 740. It's okay, but for seven, if we scan some part of seven and we could get one, right?Yeah, that's a valid problem. Uh, for that, uh, what we can do is we could we could add additional features. So that, uh, one so we can search for specific features, often digit digit. So let's say,uh, we could Instead of searching for the entire digit, we could search for some parts of it. So let's say if I have a feature like this, then maybe it's, uh indicates the presence of zero. Okay. And if I say that, Okay, there are four features which looks like this. They are coming in an image, so I can say, Okay, these are very close to zero, so you can just break that down into small features instead of taking into account the entire dignity.So what we're doing is we're hierarchically building this storey. So even another question that you should be asking at this point is that, uh, has chosen a box size that stores all of zero in it. Right? So also, he's shifting the scan that's taking place. He's shifting that, uh, square box in this exampleby a certain amount. Right. So if you are shifting by a certain amount, you might get part of the digit. Uh, and in fact, the square maybe too small to include the full digits. Right. So these are all questions that should be in your mind right now. Uh, now, the whole idea here is that we don't have to have one layer of, uhuh, somebody who needs to mute here. Uh, okay, So the idea here is that what has shown as a set of multi layer perceptron that are working on a small set of pixels in the neighbourhood,those are then being built upon by a second layer right, which is incorporating what are the features that have been seen in the previous player? So you're stacking up these features one on top of the other that are all essentially learning partial features to start with, and then more complete features, which then finally can lead to your classification. Does that make sense? The person who asked the questionwho asked the question. Yes. Okay, so this is just building on on what you know right now, which is a multi level perception, right?Yeah, go on. Sorry. Thank you. So, uh, mhm. So the idea here is that while scanning this entire image, the MLP is saying we are using the same MLB. We're not changing its weight, so this is very important. So this is called wait sharing him here. So we are sharing the weights. We're not introducing new weights at every, uh, box here,so which helps in reducing the A total number of parameters. We will study this, uh, detailing for the slides.So the key idea is that any any layer in MLP there's only one thing which is taking the weighted sum of inputs and applying a non linearity. So you must have you must be very familiar with this, uh, expression that output off any layer is basically a weighted sum of, uhuh, inputs to the input stood from previous layer and the weight. Right. So you're just basically Sundays and put some activation function. Might be sick model any any kind of non linearity. So in this scanning approach, we are also doing the same thing. We're just taking a small part of the bigger image using, uh, those inputs, flattening them out, multiplying them with some weights and just putting some activation over it.Okay, so So this is an example where I am building the hierarchy. So as Selves are just explained that we are building hierarchy. So here you can see that output of this, uh, from this box. So the first box in this cream colour. So this output would go here in the next,uh, and output from this second box, which is shifted slightly. It would be just a decent road here. So by doing this, you're just building a compact representation of this image here.Okay, So this is one level of hierarchy. You could add another level. So you're just building over these hierarchies. So you're just learning some small features. And then, uh, on those small features, you're learning some more complex features using their combination.Okay, so you just, uh, scan. So these are the hair are different. New MLPs here. So this this MLP has, uh, one set of age. This is a new MLP. Here we are, scanning through it, okay. And then we have the final classification will happen. And so now we have sequentially added layers in one direction. We could also add, uh, complexity in the depth of it.So let's say you could have, uh, multiple different MLPs to scan on the first image itself. Earlier, I took an example of where MLP was detecting the zero.zero so you could have another MLP detects budget one another MLP for 32 for that kind of thing. And then you just basically build upon their features as well. So there is one head on. So you think. Think of this as a cube.right. And so, finally, you just can't get it. All of the features and you have a final classification.So this is how the idea of hair are key is taken into account from that horrible and visual experiment that we just build upon small features of the offer input and use those to classify, uh, actual image.Okay, so that's that's great. Let's just make sure that everybody is following this. Right. So, uh, guys, what? What do you think? Here are some of the hyper parameters.in what has been discussed up until now. What do you think are the hyper parameters? Remember, the hyper parametersare defined when we, uh, you know, kind of, uh, they're not the model parameters. The weights that are connecting one layer input layer into the next hidden layer we're talking about hyper parameters is the definition ofthe architecture and other parameters that define that architecture. Right? So, for example, in linear regressionwhere we are using, uh, you know, say some regularisation. The regularisation constant is a hyper parameter, and the step size is a hyper parameter, right? We're still going to use gradient descent to learn the weights,but we, uh are defining. Uh, you know, uh, some other aspects of the network, right? So clearly step sizes. One hyper parameter here in a multilayered perceptron. What are the hyper parameters? It's the number of hidden nodes.and the number of hidden layers, right? Those are important hyper parameters. So what do you think are the hyper parameters here?maybe the ship. The shift. Science. Okay, so one of them is the shift size. That's good. what else? sorry.Philtre sides. So by philtre you're referring to the size of the square that we are shifting. Right, So good. Okay.What else? Number of philtres. Number of Philtres, Okay. a number of hidden layers. So what are we showing here? What is this,uh, diagram showing you each of these layers that you're seeing here? Uh, you know, so that we've got this image, the input image,right? And from each of the input images where we are creating one of these blue, uh, kind of compact representations, each of those blue compact representations aredifferent Philtres, right? So, as as government said in in one set of Philtres, you may be looking for horizontal lines in others, you may be looking at vertical lines, others you might be looking at, you know, uh,lines that are, in some way curved. Right? So you're looking for all of these different types of features. So when we talk about philtres, another way of thinking of these philtres these philtres comes from image processing,right where humans used to handcraft these philtres to extract features like edges and so on. Think of them as features that are being extracted, right? And so what you're now saying is you're getting this smaller sized image, which is the compaction. And then, as government has drawn these lines across these, uh, compact representations you're saying There are different features that are extracted from the same set of small number of.all located pixels, right? So philtre is nothing other than an M by N box right that defines which philtres are which pixels are connected to each other.in that MLP. So earlier, the multi layer Perceptron be flattened out the whole image. Now we only flattening out a small piece, which is this m by N box, which we're calling peopleright? And that's getting flattened and it can have a multilayered perceptron that finally gives an output. Now we're actually using a very simple multi layer perceptron here.which is essentially just got an input and an output layer. The output layers out, putting, like you said,a non linear transformation of the weighted sum of the parts. But remember that we are looking for the same feature with this, uh, N box, right? And so as we scan across, we are not needing to change the way. It's because the weights define which feature we're extracting, whether it's a vertical line or a horizontal line at the simplest right, so we don't need to change the weights, and that's why we're doing we're sharing.okay. And then, similarly from the same set of pixels, we may want to have another feature extracted. So we are now got a new set of features and we're extracting that. The other thing to remember is right now is only talking about black and white image grayscale image.If we had a colour image, then we would actually the spirit er would not be an M by N. box. It would actually be a three dimensional box right where the third dimensionis three. So it's a M by n by three or the image that is a colour image which has got the red, green and blue.channels. right. So one way of visualising this you've got an image of some size. You are reducing the size of the image by doing the scanningright. And with every feature that you're creating is like another channel. Right? So we went from RGB Channel to another description of the same data which has a smaller X and Y axis as such of the image. But it has a depth to it, which is the number of features that have been extracted. Right. And this is a very common feature that you will see when you book shows you the more complicated structures of a CNN.You'll find that you start off with a large image with three channels and you end up with very small images, but with lots of features, lots of channels with it.Right. So this is a very, very important thing to remember when you're doing CNN's, because later on, you will see some very interesting uses of the same philtre to reduce dimensionality.Okay, so do you understand all of these concepts? the shift size. you can see that the boxes are overlapping over each other, right? And so you can have a shiftof one pixel or two pixels or whatever. So that becomes a hyper parameter. Like you said, the philtre size definitely the size of the box, the number of philtres at each layer that you're definingright, and the number of such hidden layers that are transforming the input into a smaller, more compact representation.Right is another type of parameters. So very good. And what is the shift called? What is the technical term for shift?stride. Okay, great. Excellent. Okay. Good luck. Any questions on this before it goes on? Because things will only get more complex as we go on.Okay, Wonderful. Okay, So this is the example of, uh, typical Syrian architecture. This is called the Leonard five, which was developed by young liquid.Okay, so here we can see that, uh, this is, uh, example of the box. We were talking earlier. And by scanning this, uh, moving this box across this image. So we end up with several feature maps, you can see.So let's, uh let's start moving towards, uh, terminology. So these are called the future maps here. Okay. And so let's say we have six philtres of such types. This is one philtre, so if you have six philtresThen you will have six feature maps for each philtre because one feature because one philtre will scan the entire image.So we'll have one future map similarly for six philtre six philtres. You have six feature maps. Okay. And then there is a layer called sub sampling. So where you just, uh, take the max? Uh, just sample down. So, uh, one of the most common, uh, sub sampling technique is called Max pooling. So what they do here is they take two by two, sample out of this feature map and say this has value one. This is 263, and this is forso they take the maximum out of it and say so. This, uh, two by two matrix has four as the maximum value. So for the next, uh, through the next feature map, the four will be representing one pixel here instead of four pixels.Okay, So this is basically how we sub samples. So we are just if it has 2828 dimensions, then the output will have 14 by 14 dimensions by using this, uh, two by two Max schooling.Okay, so this is called sub sampling, and then we have another conclusion. Blog, another sub sampling layer, and then we have a fully connected layer. So this is the layer which actually does the classification into 10 outputs for administrator. They will pretend for any other data. There would be different number of classes Where, uh, where we want to classify our input image to be.uh, is this clear? So we will understand all these terms, uh, in the next slaves. So this is the typical architecture. So every architecture of the CNN has some, uh, modification of it,okay. When you are saying that there are six feature maps, you're basically talking about the third dimension, which is the under six channelsthat are being created. Yes. So here. You could say this is a volume which have six dimensions. Six depth. 28 is the time. 20 at theheight. And are you going to walk through how they get from 32 by 32 28 20 years? Yes. Okay. Thank you.okay? Okay, So there was one thing I want to visualise here. Yeah, so? So this is a typical grayscale image. So this is the original image you can see here. And this is just a zoom in version, so you can see that every pixel has a value from 0 to 2. 56 to 55. Sorry.So you can see, uh, the white pixel here it has value of 2. 55. Is the number eligible on the left hand side?okay. And for a black pixel, let's say, down here, the value is, uh, close to zero. Okay, so, uh, this is the representation of grayscale image, soSo now I just wanted to visualise that how this future would work. So here we have. uh, let's on the left hand side. You have this, uh, three by three matrix. Right? So what we're doing here is just, uh here in the centre, you have a philtre by three by three philtre So the it's called sharpen philtre. And it has, uh, these values. So what we are doing here is that just taking the value for each box in this red metricsand just doing an element wise multiplication with this, uh, sharp and philtre. And the output is represented here in the right hand side. So, for example,uh, let's take something near the so you can see here. Uh, the left, the left, and the first element in this, uh,read matrix is 103. You can see it here. right. So you're multiplying it with zero and then 128 with minus one and so on and so forth. And the output of this entire operation is just a single value, which is minus 157. You can see it in the middle, and this is represented here.uh, one pixel value in the right image. Okay, so this is basically the process of applying any philtre here.So, uh, we've got an answer. Which is minus 157. Yes. Uh, be clipped to zero. It will be close to zero.okay. And so you can see here that while working with the edges here so there won't be three values available.Right? So that's why the right image is padded with black border. That's all zeros it contains okay? So, uh, the key idea here is that these features these these philtres basically give rise to different feature maps. So this, this is called sharp and philtre.There is another thing called blur Philtre. So what does this basically takes the, uh, centre value of, uh, this red metricsand just adds, uh, surrounding pixel values basically smooth out the entire image so you can see that, uh, the multiplication happening and the images looks a bit blurry or, you could say, smoothed out image.Okay. So the idea to understand here is that we can have different types of these features. Sorry. Philtres there is called right, Sobel.So you can say it's kind. It's, uh, edges. It will. This is the right Sobel philtre. You can see the values are changing. So there is a left Sobel which detects different orientation of hedges. There is, uh,top Sobel, which identifies different orientations of the edges. So basically, everything is dependent on this philtre. So these are basically featured maps.Okay, so now that we have some visual understanding of how philtre looks and what and this is this is how the future maps would look.Okay, so there is another example of this image. So this is the original image. Okay, Now, if I apply, sharpen, uh around it, you can see it's got a bit sharp.And if you you stop symbol on it, it detects, uh, like horizontal edges. If I apply right Sobel, it detects vertical edges so on and so forth.is this clear? Yes, sir. Okay. so these weights are okay, So, uh, which no one is asking a question here. Uh, how? Well, normalising the pixel values affect the neural network.Um, so we should make sure you don't send it privately because those questions come to me, Uh, is not able to see it, but I've explained this, right? So when you talk about normalising the pixel values, what are you referring to? What you're talking about theapplication of these philtres. a new a new mutants piece. so, like dividing each pixel value by 2. 55.Okay, so that is really bringing the scale down to become from 0 to 1, right? Is that what you're? Okay, So what you're saying is, how does the normalisation of pixel values affect the neural network?a good book. Do you want to take this socialite? Uh, so please go ahead. Okay. So essentially, visual, what happens with the neural network when your input layer, uh, is essentially got very differing skills, right for each of the teachers. Then what is happening to the cost function that you're trying to minimise this that is stretched in certain directions and squeezed in other directions.Right. So whenever you actually calculate the gradient, you start kind of bouncing between points and don't move necessarily in the direction that gives you the, uh, which leads you directly to the ideal, uh, solution. Right? So what happens when you scale or normalise the numbers, All of the skills of all of the inputs? What ends up happening is that you get a much more rounder shift,uh, cost function, and so you will actually start to now the first known more directly towards the minimum,so it speeds up the minimisation of the past. That's the advantage of doing this normalisation okay? right. Anybody else have any questions around the application of the philtres themselves?are you making the Connexion between the fact that these philtres that are being played with up here, the colonel's as they're being referred to here, are essentially handcrafted Wales. Right? So you only have seven or eight philtres here.that are shown where the minus 101 minus 20 to minus 101 is one set of weights that have been handcrafted.Now, if you think about what a multilayered Perceptron is doing, it's actually learning these. It's learning these weights,right? So rather than us having to humanly created this, um, these philtres that we then know what kind of feature is going to be extracted by them by each application of the philtre throughout the image. What we are saying is we can actually now with neural networks, learn the weights, which will extract features that humans may not be able to interpret.but the neural network finds them useful. because they have been able to minimise the cost function as it is.does that make sense? so we are automatically extracting features that humans may not understand. right through each of these applications. Where the waves that you're seeing here, the minus 101 minus zero minus 101 are waves that are being set by the neural network automatically.right. And so we are learning these philtres. We have an infinite number of philtres we can learn here.that are each tuned to the final result of what we are trying to achieve. In this case, the example that government was talking about it was to identify whether the image contains a zero or a one or two and each of the digitalright, So we don't know what those features are out here is showing you examples of well understood teachers that have been drafted by image processing research.any questions on this comment of mine. No. Okay, carry on. listen. So, uh, this thing which we just discussed is called coalition or a sliding dot org in mathematical terms, uh, to represent it. Uh, we can,uh okay. So this is your H metrics. You can call it the photo. and this capital F is your image. Okay.Uh, so let's say for, uh, I'll take an example of this portion of this image. I'm just, uh, mathematically describing what we have just discussed. Okay,so here we are going from minus Kate. Okay, for let's say, let's say this philtre will have zero in the centre zeroth index.instead of beginning from any side, we begin from the centre. So this has, uh, zero comma zero. Uh, Index, this has, uh,minus one comma one. I could have minus one for my one. This is my new school, Uh this is minus one common minus one just to be clear.And this is, uh, one comma one. And this is one common minus one. So basically, we are saying that the loop power fromminus 1 to 1 in case of a three dimensional feature or philtre so for, Let's say. four g three or three. So Okay,the left corner will be minus 11. the corner with bottom, Yeah. mhm. uh, one here because we are going from, uh, which is, uh,so So, uh, this is the X one. And this is why? right. So, uh, but the other way around. Right. So why is pointing downwards?Yeah. So the coordinator, there will be a minus 11, left bottom. X is minus right the X coordinate ofminus one. uh this should be minus 11. okay, so Okay, So, uh, idea here is So let's say we have this original image, and we want to, uh, slide this fritter across this entire image. And I want to have an output G, which is my feature map. You could sayokay. So what I'm gonna do here is, um So starting with U N. Vehicle to minus one here in this submission,you equal to minus one and equal to minus one. So I will take the minus one minus 11 element of this, uh, this edge metrics, which is the A.Okay. And, uh, I plus Youth Index. So I am calculating for G three of three. So this is +0123 and again. 0123. So this is my G three comma three.Okay. So if I take, uh, take this philtre and, uh, make the cost cross correlation, I will have a single value, which will be substituted in the place of E here.Right. So what I'm looking here is that, uh, eyes here three and us minus one. And Jay is also three.This is the icon DJ and J minus one. So I'm looking at second element here. So for her 01 to zero. we want. So to buy second by second element is this so I'm multiplying, uh, small a from the philtre with this matrix A herewith a element of these, uh, metrics. and similarly, I'm just looping over. So being small capital B plus small capital C includes. So this way, this time calculating the, uh, waited waited some hereand this will be a single output, which will be replaced here in my future map. Uh, so let's see if I have this. This is my G output. So in place of E here, I will have one single value, which will be the output of this entire operation.Uh, okay. So basically, uh, we are just representing what we have done till now in mathematical terms, because we are going to use this cross correlation and the idea behind it, Uh, mathematicallyfind expression for back propagation. Uh, is this clear? Yes, sir. okay? uh, So there are a few examples. Uh, this is the original image, and this is the philtre. So after, uh, sliding this philtre on the original image we get this is everything in This is the output of the free to map. This is the sharpen philtre. This is the blur philtre. And this is an edge detector.Okay, so now, uh, there's another term which is called convolution, so it is very similar to, uh cross cross correlation. But the key idea here is that while doing these calculations, your future map will be rotated by one or two degrees.Okay. Uh, so there is a visual example here, so So let's say this is your fault. The A B C D e f g h i and this is your input image.and you want to calculate, uh, the feature at some representation for on the output. So let's say you take, uh, this portion of your input image.three by three matrix. And you, uh, take the dot product with the element byproduct with these metrics. So you see here they will be, uh, multiplied with zero B also with zero except the ICT. Uh, I will get multiplied with one, so the output would be, uh and it will go in this place in the place of centre of these metrics, so in here.so in here, the central element will be I right. So if you do this for this entire image, you will see that your failure just got flipped by 180 degrees.okay. And to see a visual representation. So consider this. This has an image where all are all elements are zero. Only one has very one. And this is how your philtre looks like. So there is the black edge black pixel on this, uh, left top and white on this bottom. Right. And after performing this cross correlation, your philtre just got flipped. The white is now here on the above.Okay, so the idea behind conclusion is that if you just, uh, flip your philtre by 12 degrees and then blue cross correlation. Uh, then this term is called Coalition. So the basic idea is that we are going to use this cross correlation and conclusion to find the mathematical expressions for back propagation, so it will come hand in later.okay. It's important to recognise that what is actually happening in the forward fast is actually cross correlation. It's not convolution. Most people cannot get confused and think that that's the convolution operation. Mathematically, you're actually doing a cross correlation.Yes. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So, uh, mathematically. So we saw that in cross correlation. We are going to, uh, multiply in this direction. So if we have a free to called a B c e f g h i j So we will multiply it with There is no image in this direction.Okay, we'll begin from the top left and move towards the bottom. Right. But in the case of convolution, uh, we move from bottomto the top. Okay. So because the future has rotated and just changing the sign here, uh, will assist in that happening, soOkay, Uh, you can just explore this on your own later on. If you just try to write these expressions down and you will be able to figure out that we're just recreating the philtreand doing the cross correlation, okay? Okay, so So till now we discuss these handcrafted philtres like the blur sharpen, agitation, etcetera. But these are the things which the model learns as just described. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna visualise these features for the religion. It Okay, Uh, so let me first explain that how these, uhhow these architectures look like. Okay, so, uh, the input here is, uh, before we go into the architecture, can we just, uh, do a little bit of discussion around how the philtre size impact, the output image size, But is that coming after this?Yes. I was just trying to bring Troy. I don't have, uh Okay. Okay. So let's say religion yet We use colour images, so let's say it will be a three dimensional image.And let's say it is 2. 56 by 2. 56 with three channels of input. Okay, so now we want to, uh, involved used 32 philtres here.Okay of dimensions, Uh, three by three. Okay, So this is how you generally defining your chaos or you're open source, uh, libraries, but under the hood. Uh, what is happening is that each philtre will have dimensionsthree by three. And this three, the depth is coming from the input. because the input image has three channels as death. So you're each philtre will also have a depth of three. Okay, so what we do here is that we take small, uh,crop of size three by three hair from this bigger image. three by three by three And we just, uh, do an element wise multiplication of all these elements in this cubewith this philtre. Okay, So if there are, let's say, uh, three numbers here and three numbers in the first, uh, slice. Then you just, uh, do the cross correlation, and there would be one output.Okay. And you do same for all the layers. So for second slice here also, okay, and output of this result would be single number.this is very important to note. Okay, so after conclusion where there will be one value here. So you do this for across entire this image. So you have access right of one.so let's let's leave it to them to come up with the answer. Okay, So with the stride of one pixel means that you're shifting by one pixel to the right all the way till you get to the end of the image, right? So recognise that you get to the end of the image when the right side of your philtre reaches the edge. Okay, so there's no paddingfor those of you know what padding is. There's no padding. For those of you who don't know about padding, just don't worry about it. Just tell us what is going to be the size of the image that comes out on the other side when we do the scanning. Now the stride works left to rightand talk to bottom. right. So as you scan across, you're going one pixel at a time and going to the next position where the philtre is applied. And then when you get to the end, you shift the philtre down by one,uh, pixel and apply it again. Correct? Yes, sir. Okay. So what is going to be the size of the image that is coming out on the other end? Or the the two dimensional array that's coming out at the end? Because remember what is sayingthat the three by three by three is producing only one number, so the multilayered Perceptron is taking27 inputs and is out putting one value. Okay, So what you're getting as a result of applying this philtre is a two dimensionalmatrix of numbers, and I want to know the dimensionality of that. 54. other ways, okay? there were two people speaking. So one person said to 54.And what was the other person saying? I think, uh, zero comma zero is concerned at the centre, and, uh, the other things are taken at that size in the same way you look at work,right? So, like I said, the we are resuming zero padding go padding right now. Right? So your philtre starts from the edge and takes the first three into account.right, and then it moves by one and moves by one. Right? So the size is going to be there. One answer that's been given us 254.Is that the number of rows or the number of columns, or what is to 54? I think both. Okay, Anybody else have a different answer?no sort of 54 and 54 in total Tito. in 2. 32. Okay, 32 because we've got 32 philtres. Good. Okay. I have been looking for one philtre with Excellent. Okay, so 254 by 2. 50 for 5. 32 will be the third dimension.Uh, just for this philtre Yes, output will be just a matrix. Uh, considering for just one philtre, this is just one,Uh, that's correct that we will have 32 such philtres. So for each of that philtre, we will have one,to the output. Yes. Yes. And then that will build up to 30 to do that. Yeah. Perfect. Perfect. Okay, So what happens now if we make the stride?Ooh! Okay, so now let's make the strive to what becomes the output size now? Does the output size change?instead. How much does it change? Uh, third dimension in the same 1. 27 1 27 127. So how did you come up with 1. 27?sir. And if you take in putting measures in and the philtres. I just Yes. And we We are taking a straight to that isminus Yes. And we are adding one to the and mine the eff s blossom. Okay. Do you want to write the formula they're given? You've got access toYes, Uh, like the formula, which, uh Okay, can you please repeat and I say important measure that is 256 in 2016 and a filtered site.and at that stage. the farm law of the output. The message will be and minus f s plus one. listen. so that would be a 56 minus.three dots. Bye. HM. That doesn't seems correct. It's two less 127. So now you've got 253 divided by two, right?So what happens? We've got a decimal number there. So I have that too. From the looks. you will take in digital partnership.If we have fraction, then we protect right? so Yeah. So that is the same formula. Uh, only were riding fighting out here. Right? Fighting is zero w minus scale over this. That's whywhich is fine. And then what you're saying is we are taking the interior part. So are we rounding up or are we rounding down?so if there is greater than five, then we are all being up. but now it's point. What do we do? I think running, don't you?Okay, so let's just take a small example of, uh, seven by seven image, right? and what is happening here when we are not doing a padding, So the first one is three by three.the philtre application. And then we're taking a stride of two, which means now we're starting from pixel, too.23. And, uh, so we're starting the numbering from zero. Right, So 0 to 6 is the pixel numbering. Okay,Right. And now we're doing a three by three. right. So the three by three the first philtre, then we're taking a stride of two.so we start from now 23 and four. And now we take another stride of two, which gives us now. four, five and six.right. So in this case, if we look at the formula, what's happening is N is seven minus three. great.stride is too so seven minus 3/2. which is three, right? So that's 4/2. That's 13, so we can see we have created three. Now the problem comes when we have an eight by eight image, right? And now we have an issue in that if we had another pixels in rows and columns.we basically not be able to do any further, right? So if we had an eight by eight image, if you can just draw that additional problem and go.Now, when we go for the stride of two, we are going over the edge, so we can't do anymore, right? So we are always looking at the number below, as the output were basically ignoring the that last follow. And that last room. Right? So we will always take the lower number out here.right. okay? So now my question is, how many parameters does the neural network have just in this layer?So who's gonna tell me that now? How many parameters? Now we've got 32 philtres. We've got a three by three philtres,right? And an RGB image. How many parameters do we need to learn in this? one pair of lives. who's gonna tell us?930 two. Sorry. nine by 30 to 1930 to 19 to 19 to 32. Okay. Any other answers? 20 7 to 32. Okay. Any other answers?thanks. Nobody else wants to suggest the answer. 20 730 to 30 two. Correct. So the reason why it's 27 by 32 and not nine by 32 it would be nine by 32 if we had a.grayscale image, right? We didn't have the channel. So you must always remember that we have got a three dimensional Fridawhere the third dimensions depth is defined by the number of input channels to that live. Okay, good. Now, what would be the number of parameters that needs to be learned? If we were not using CNN,we were actually using a multilayered percent promise. that depends on the number of notes hidden next to them. Iwant the same number of notes as I have in the hidden layer in the CNN. So how many notes do I have in the hidden layer in the CNN?trick questions. mhm. 56. Close to 56. Crusty. That is my input layer. Right? So that's 2. 56 times 2, 56 times three.that's the input Lear sites. what it was before. Before 254 by 254. right. by 32 right, and how many parameters would we have to learn?uh, we have to do, like the four 130 two cross, uh, test is too extreme. right. So we're basically multiplying all of these, right? Because every note in the input layer must be connected to every note and the output.right, So it's 256 squared, multiplied by three. multiplied by 254 squared, multiplied by 32. right. which one is big?There's no argument, right? I mean, we are comparing a very large number of parameters here with just 27 multiplied by 32.right, and this is a huge advantage of CNN. It's the weird. sharing with sharing. That's happening. That is a hugely important aspect.Oh, CNN. Okay, so you appreciate that. And what have we talked about that as the number of parameters increases, what do we need to do? We need a lot more data to learn them.right. And so we are actually talking about unnecessarily learning a lot of weights. Whereas we know that really what we're looking for is a scan through theright. So hopefully this is clear to you that actually the CNN can be represented as a multi layer perceptron also. So the multi layer Perceptron can do the work of the CNN as we see it right now, but the number of parameters is going to be much larger.okay, and so it's much more difficult to learn the same representation comparative. Okay, so here's another question.Now we have a 54 by 2. 54 by 32. right, and we are again using. Now we are using a five by five philtres.So what is going to be the dimensions of the next left? 54 by 254. by 32. right. So now we're using a five by five philtre.how many such features, let's say 64. such tried stride of, mm. 124 into 1, 24 and 60 for the lesson.Mm. for 254. find us. five, divided by two plus one. so that's 249 divided by two. 1 24 +11 25 1 25 by 125 by 64.how many parameters. and what will be the shape of the philtre? you tell me. Uh, sorry. Was that good book?Uh, that's part of the number 64. 55 or 60. Uh, And so we got an answer here for the number of parameters, I think.Okay, 25 by 64. So he said it could be what we do here. pretty good. so one person's answer is 25 by 64.Don't you find it that you don't look beautiful? 25 and 32. That's right. Okay. And so they will be. Bias is also right. Yes.good point. Thank you for keeping us right there. So in the last one, also, we forgot about the biases thatso remember the bias stone is important, right? What does the bias give us gives us? It gives us a fine transformation.Right? So we must have that constant added and also so, plus 64 there and we've got the total number of parameters yet.Okay, Good. Excellent. Okay. Uh, let's, uh, move on. I think hopefully everybody's got anybody. Got a question here? I know there are a few of you who have dealt with CNN's and done some deep learning. That does not mean that people who are not understanding this can't ask questions.Okay, So for those of you who are new to this, this is very, very important that you understand this. Okay, here's another. Okay, Let's go. There is another question I want to ask you, okay?which is the number of computations you're doing. so floating point operations, floating point operations do you need to do here? But I believe that as an exercise for you, let's carry on.okay? Okay, So next, uh, was trying to visualise these features. So? So what we have here is so he worked with it was that we took an RGB image.and used 32 philtres to create 32 future maps. Okay, so what we're basically doing is we are just, uh, cross finding the cross correlation of each of this philtre with entire image. So as we, uh, looked earlier, uh, visual representation of cross correlation. So I just wanted to visualise that what these 32 philtres look like. Okay, SoI'm going to show you that how they look like, So I'm using really 16 for that. That's an architecture. It's a CNN architecture, very common.So it has taken, uh, RGB images of size 24 by 24. And so these are, uh this is the basic basic architecture. So it has to conclusion blockseach using 64 philtres. It then has a max full, then to conclusion blocks of 128. uh, philtres each again for school and then three conclusions by, uh, containing 2. 56 philtres and so on. You can see here and then we have a fully connected layer. Uh, the final layer, which classifies each imagine 2000 categories.This is the basic architecture of this video. 16. So, what we're trying to do here that in each conclusion lock so you can see there are 60 for future maps. We will just see how the 16th of future maps look like.So there are 1 28 ft high maps. We will look at each of them. Okay. So for the sake of convenience, I am only displaying features for these four or five players. The first, the very first conclusion there. The fourth player. 7, 1114. Okay, so let's just have a look at them.So this is, uh, first, uh, output of the conclusion block. Okay, so in what is this image of a house? Okay. And, uh, there are three, philtres of this dimension three by three by three.right. So after, uh, cross correlation of one philtre with the entire image, we get one feature map like this.Okay. For 60 for Philtres, 50 for such 60. For such philtres, we have 64 future maps, so you can see that each of the philtre is, uh,trying to highlight some specific features. So if you see here, this philtre is highlighting grass here.uh, this philtre here is highlighting the pillars. Or you could say the vertical edges. Okay. And, uhthis philtre here is highlighting the door so you can see each philtre is, uh, targeting some features.All right, so next I'm moving on to the fourth layer. So this was the layer of confusion blocks having 128 philtres.Okay, so I'm not showing all of the 128 philtres just because it gets very messy. So these are just 60 for philtres out of this 1. 28 here. So you can see, uh, compared from this is compared from the first congressional put, this one has become a little bit more detailed or abstract. You could say there is a lot more detail. There is a lot more textual information here.Some, uh, very dark. Some are highlighting several features. Okay, this is the fourth layer next, moving on to the seventh layer so you can see, uh, things are getting more abstract here. It's difficult to describe what features. Uh, CNN is learning,but we can see that something different is happening with each feature map. So there is a definition of house here, but in here, we have totally lost it. Maybe this this philtre would was looking for something else. which is not present in this feature in this image,maybe something like that. Okay, so now we have reached 11th layer. It has, I think, 2. 56 philtres and I'm displaying only 64 corresponding feature maps out of these two physics. Okay, No, things have become more abstract. And then, you know, 15th layer,uh, things become even more abstract. You could see that that some freedom maps are, uh, not saying anything at all. For example, there's there's only slight activation here, but for some philtres, there are a lot of evacuations happening.and in 17 player. So this has, uh, 512 feature maps and displaying only 64. You could see that only some some part of theafter the conclusion. Output has some information in it. Rest everything is just shut down. Okay, so let me just go through that again. So this is the first congressional put second. So ifeverybody realising that each of these small images is one layer now in that output right in this, so I shouldn't say one layer one feature, right? So one channel within the fourth layer. So everybody using, uh, you know, onepretty good right to generate each of these small images here, Right? And we're seeing What is it that it is learning from this image? And of course, this is the house. And, like, uh, was saying the V G architecture has been developed to learn 1000 different classes, right? So for different classes of images, you'll have different features, uh, getting highlighted right. And as we go throughright now, we are identifying edges and some relationships between those edges. But we're basically as we go, deeper and deeper,it actually becomes much more abstract, but is useful finally to make a classification that this is a house as opposed to an elephantright. Okay. Carry on group. Yeah. So this was the output of first conclusion block. 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th. And finally, we could use this output for classification. So basically, what we have done here is that we took an image and we extracted features out of that,and to some to that extent, that we are able to build a classified over it. That when we have an image of in house, we could say some features get activated if we have, uh, image of human that several different features get activated, and then we can use these activations to basically just classify or input dimension.Right. So here have how blood cells are. Okay, So the first output you could see here is that, uh, several feature maps are looking at the skin. Some are looking at beard. Some are looking at this the turbo and some are looking at the edges. So this is this little These feature maps would work for any human rights.On the second conclusion output, you could see things become more abstract. Then in third National Boardfort, you can see that this, uh, these features around here, they somehow represent I guess that human face that eyes and mouth Maybe that's my guess. I'm not sure.And again, in the just the final conclusion block things become very extracted. Only few future master activity dressed are just shut down.So here we have, uh, to human faces in the image so you could see in the final layer. So I'm showing, uh, all the 512 accusations here in the final conclusion block. So you could see, uh, things which are highlighted here in yellow.So similar features have been activated here. If you take a look at these two, these two here, and these two here, they look pretty similar.So we expect that any human, uh, face would excite these, uh, future maps of this, uh, Jeanette. And then later we can use this information, uh, to just classify that which category an image belongs to.Remember that the objective here is not to discriminate and identify between Luke and myself. Here. This is actually just to classify it into, uh, face versus house.Yes. So here we have a face versus house, so you can see that, uh, these are the features activated and different set of features activated in the final constitution outputso you can see they are not in this In this area, these we can have some not activity. any questions on this.Okay, Uh, we are at the end of the lecture, so I think Is this a good place to stop? Yes. Great. Excellent. Okay. So thank you so much for this. I think that's been wonderful. Uh, folks, uh, carry on with CNN's in on Saturday, so if there are no questions now, we'll end this session.Okay. No questions. So I'm ending the session. Thank you. Thanks, everyone. Thank you, sir.", 'start_time': '00:00:23', 'end_time': '01:28:14'}, {'Topic': 'Image Processing', 'transcript': "okay? Okay, So there was one thing I want to visualise here. Yeah, so? So this is a typical grayscale image. So this is the original image you can see here. And this is just a zoom in version, so you can see that every pixel has a value from 0 to 2. 56 to 55. Sorry.So you can see, uh, the white pixel here it has value of 2. 55. Is the number eligible on the left hand side?okay. And for a black pixel, let's say, down here, the value is, uh, close to zero. Okay, so, uh, this is the representation of grayscale image, soSo now I just wanted to visualise that how this future would work. So here we have. uh, let's on the left hand side. You have this, uh, three by three matrix. Right? So what we're doing here is just, uh here in the centre, you have a philtre by three by three philtre So the it's called sharpen philtre. And it has, uh, these values. So what we are doing here is that just taking the value for each box in this red metricsand just doing an element wise multiplication with this, uh, sharp and philtre. And the output is represented here in the right hand side. So, for example,uh, let's take something near the so you can see here. Uh, the left, the left, and the first element in this, uh,read matrix is 103. You can see it here. right. So you're multiplying it with zero and then 128 with minus one and so on and so forth. And the output of this entire operation is just a single value, which is minus 157. You can see it in the middle, and this is represented here.uh, one pixel value in the right image. Okay, so this is basically the process of applying any philtre here.So, uh, we've got an answer. Which is minus 157. Yes. Uh, be clipped to zero. It will be close to zero.okay. And so you can see here that while working with the edges here so there won't be three values available.Right? So that's why the right image is padded with black border. That's all zeros it contains okay? So, uh, the key idea here is that these features these these philtres basically give rise to different feature maps. So this, this is called sharp and philtre.", 'start_time': '00:35:17', 'end_time': '00:38:39'}, {'Topic': 'Convolution and Cross Correlation', 'transcript': "Okay, so now, uh, there's another term which is called convolution, so it is very similar to, uh cross cross correlation. But the key idea here is that while doing these calculations, your future map will be rotated by one or two degrees.Okay. Uh, so there is a visual example here, so So let's say this is your fault. The A B C D e f g h i and this is your input image.and you want to calculate, uh, the feature at some representation for on the output. So let's say you take, uh, this portion of your input image.three by three matrix. And you, uh, take the dot product with the element byproduct with these metrics. So you see here they will be, uh, multiplied with zero B also with zero except the ICT. Uh, I will get multiplied with one, so the output would be, uh and it will go in this place in the place of centre of these metrics, so in here.so in here, the central element will be I right. So if you do this for this entire image, you will see that your failure just got flipped by 180 degrees.okay. And to see a visual representation. So consider this. This has an image where all are all elements are zero. Only one has very one. And this is how your philtre looks like. So there is the black edge black pixel on this, uh, left top and white on this bottom. Right. And after performing this cross correlation, your philtre just got flipped. The white is now here on the above.Okay, so the idea behind conclusion is that if you just, uh, flip your philtre by 12 degrees and then blue cross correlation. Uh, then this term is called Coalition. So the basic idea is that we are going to use this cross correlation and conclusion to find the mathematical expressions for back propagation, so it will come hand in later.okay. It's important to recognise that what is actually happening in the forward fast is actually cross correlation. It's not convolution. Most people cannot get confused and think that that's the convolution operation. Mathematically, you're actually doing a cross correlation.Yes. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So, uh, mathematically. So we saw that in cross correlation. We are going to, uh, multiply in this direction. So if we have a free to called a B c e f g h i j So we will multiply it with There is no image in this direction.Okay, we'll begin from the top left and move towards the bottom. Right. But in the case of convolution, uh, we move from bottomto the top. Okay. So because the future has rotated and just changing the sign here, uh, will assist in that happening, soOkay, Uh, you can just explore this on your own later on. If you just try to write these expressions down and you will be able to figure out that we're just recreating the philtre", 'start_time': '00:51:43', 'end_time': '00:55:29'}, {'Topic': 'Hyperparameters', 'transcript': "Okay, so that's that's great. Let's just make sure that everybody is following this. Right. So, uh, guys, what? What do you think? Here are some of the hyper parameters.in what has been discussed up until now. What do you think are the hyper parameters? Remember, the hyper parametersare defined when we, uh, you know, kind of, uh, they're not the model parameters. The weights that are connecting one layer input layer into the next hidden layer we're talking about hyper parameters is the definition ofthe architecture and other parameters that define that architecture. Right? So, for example, in linear regressionwhere we are using, uh, you know, say some regularisation. The regularisation constant is a hyper parameter, and the step size is a hyper parameter, right? We're still going to use gradient descent to learn the weights,but we, uh are defining. Uh, you know, uh, some other aspects of the network, right? So clearly step sizes. One hyper parameter here in a multilayered perceptron. What are the hyper parameters? It's the number of hidden nodes.and the number of hidden layers, right? Those are important hyper parameters. So what do you think are the hyper parameters here?maybe the ship. The shift. Science. Okay, so one of them is the shift size. That's good. what else? sorry.Philtre sides. So by philtre you're referring to the size of the square that we are shifting. Right, So good. Okay.What else? Number of philtres. Number of Philtres, Okay. a number of hidden layers. So what are we showing here? What is this,uh, diagram showing you each of these layers that you're seeing here? Uh, you know, so that we've got this image, the input image,right? And from each of the input images where we are creating one of these blue, uh, kind of compact representations, each of those blue compact representations aredifferent Philtres, right? So, as as government said in in one set of Philtres, you may be looking for horizontal lines in others, you may be looking at vertical lines, others you might be looking at, you know, uh,lines that are, in some way curved. Right? So you're looking for all of these different types of features. So when we talk about philtres, another way of thinking of these philtres these philtres comes from image processing,right where humans used to handcraft these philtres to extract features like edges and so on. Think of them as features that are being extracted, right? And so what you're now saying is you're getting this smaller sized image, which is the compaction. And then, as government has drawn these lines across these, uh, compact representations you're saying There are different features that are extracted from the same set of small number of.all located pixels, right? So philtre is nothing other than an M by N box right that defines which philtres are which pixels are connected to each other.in that MLP. So earlier, the multi layer Perceptron be flattened out the whole image. Now we only flattening out a small piece, which is this m by N box, which we're calling peopleright? And that's getting flattened and it can have a multilayered perceptron that finally gives an output. Now we're actually using a very simple multi layer perceptron here.which is essentially just got an input and an output layer. The output layers out, putting, like you said,a non linear transformation of the weighted sum of the parts. But remember that we are looking for the same feature with this, uh, N box, right? And so as we scan across, we are not needing to change the way. It's because the weights define which feature we're extracting, whether it's a vertical line or a horizontal line at the simplest right, so we don't need to change the weights, and that's why we're doing we're sharing.okay. And then, similarly from the same set of pixels, we may want to have another feature extracted. So we are now got a new set of features and we're extracting that. The other thing to remember is right now is only talking about black and white image grayscale image.If we had a colour image, then we would actually the spirit er would not be an M by N. box. It would actually be a three dimensional box right where the third dimensionis three. So it's a M by n by three or the image that is a colour image which has got the red, green and blue.channels. right. So one way of visualising this you've got an image of some size. You are reducing the size of the image by doing the scanningright. And with every feature that you're creating is like another channel. Right? So we went from RGB Channel to another description of the same data which has a smaller X and Y axis as such of the image. But it has a depth to it, which is the number of features that have been extracted. Right. And this is a very common feature that you will see when you book shows you the more complicated structures of a CNN.You'll find that you start off with a large image with three channels and you end up with very small images, but with lots of features, lots of channels with it.Right. So this is a very, very important thing to remember when you're doing CNN's, because later on, you will see some very interesting uses of the same philtre to reduce dimensionality.Okay, so do you understand all of these concepts? the shift size. you can see that the boxes are overlapping over each other, right? And so you can have a shiftof one pixel or two pixels or whatever. So that becomes a hyper parameter. Like you said, the philtre size definitely the size of the box, the number of philtres at each layer that you're definingright, and the number of such hidden layers that are transforming the input into a smaller, more compact representation.Right is another type of parameters. So very good. And what is the shift called? What is the technical term for shift?stride. Okay, great. Excellent. Okay. Good luck. Any questions on this before it goes on?

Was he defined a new metric called gain ratio were given an attribute? A where we were considering doing a split of our sample of data as so That's the sample.and that is an attribute. where earlier we were just using the information gain to make a decision on whether to partition or a or some other attribute.he divided it by this metrical split information. and if we look at split information what we're doing here is we're saying that attribute a has C values that it takes so domains of sides seeand each of the s eyes, other partitions. created. bye value. Let's say a I write So a takes values a one a two to a c and s I is the partition that has the value ai with it. Remember, this is within the training, right?So in effect, this here is the probability of a is equal to a I. And so what we've got here is nothing other than probability ofis equal to a I log probability of a is equal to a I. So that's actually entropy. But the entropy here is being calculated not on theoutput variable y. It's been calculated on a And why are we thinking that is useful? Well, if we have an attribute, athat has uniform distribution. in our data across all of its many values. We are going to get a set of smallpartitions, right associated with each of our values a one a two a C. If, on the other hand, we had our attribute A which was primarily to values even and a two and the other values, even though there were c of them were very rare.What we are saying is, well, you know, we're still really the effective number of values that is taking is really to it's not see right because there's this very small partitions that gets skimmed off the data, but we still have a small number of large partitions that are getting propagated through the tree.so we would prefer not to use a if we had a distribution that helped us a real blow in terms of all of us.", 'keywords': ['Heuristics', 'Decision Trees', 'Gain Ratio'], 'summary': 'The transcript discusses heuristics in decision trees, particularly focusing on a discovery by Quinlan regarding the bias in information gain towards attributes with numerous values. This bias can lead to the creation of bushy trees that partition data into smaller subsets, which inherently have a higher probability of being pure. To address this issue, Quinlan introduced a new metric called gain ratio, which modifies the traditional information gain metric by incorporating split information. The explanation delves into how this gain ratio is calculated based on the probability of an attribute taking on specific values and its implications on the purity of partitions. It emphasizes the importance of choosing attributes wisely based on their distribution, suggesting that attributes with a uniform distribution across many values may lead to smaller, less informative partitions, while attributes with a concentrated distribution are more effective.'}, {'topic': 'Conclusion and Future Topics', 'start_time': '00:57:14', 'end_time': '00:59:00', 'transcript': "of the partitions becoming small, and we would rather use if it was effectively lower.

And so we are really trying to define this set,and we have seen that the disjunction of conjunctions is actually capable of describing any of these sets.

And so this kind of, uh, language restriction is what is referred to as a restriction bias.and an alternative is what is called a preference bias, which is related to how we search the space of all hypotheses.right. And so when we do a greedy search of the kind that we have just done in decision trees where we are saying I'm going to start to grow my treeand I'm going to choose an attribute at a time that maximises My information came. I'm doing a greedy search here. I'm defining a reference on one type of three as opposed to another type of tree.right and an important reference bias is this thing called Occam's Razor, which says that we should prefer simplest hypotheses that fit the data well.right.

Was he defined a new metric called gain ratio were given an attribute? A where we were considering doing a split of our sample of data as so That's the sample.and that is an attribute. where earlier we were just using the information gain to make a decision on whether to partition or a or some other attribute.he divided it by this metrical split information. and if we look at split information what we're doing here is we're saying that attribute a has C values that it takes so domains of sides seeand each of the s eyes, other partitions. created. bye value.

Remember, this is within the training, right?So in effect, this here is the probability of a is equal to a I. And so what we've got here is nothing other than probability ofis equal to a I log probability of a is equal to a I. So that's actually entropy. But the entropy here is being calculated not on theoutput variable y. It's been calculated on a And why are we thinking that is useful? Well, if we have an attribute, athat has uniform distribution. in our data across all of its many values. We are going to get a set of smallpartitions, right associated with each of our values a one a two a C. If, on the other hand, we had our attribute A which was primarily to values even and a two and the other values, even though there were c of them were very rare.What we are saying is, well, you know, we're still really the effective number of values that is taking is really to it's not see right because there's this very small partitions that gets skimmed off the data, but we still have a small number of large partitions that are getting propagated through the tree.so we would prefer not to use a if we had a distribution that helped us a real blow in terms of all of us.", 'start_time': '00:53:14', 'end_time': '00:57:13'}, {'Topic': 'Conclusion and Future Topics', 'transcript': "of the partitions becoming small, and we would rather use if it was effectively lower.

Right? So let's say, are you interested inuh, bet on anybody winning, right, because the possibilities are very similar. So, in effect, what we're doing here is a form of very simple machine learning. We have datathis data is about matches that have been played in the past, right? We're using those experiences so we can think of this data as experiencesfrom which we want to learn. Uh, some information, some knowledge that can help us make decisions. Right.So if we look at data that has a binary outcome like this, you can either win or not win. Do you know, from a probability perspective, what kind of probability distribution This is,um, your own. Have you heard of a Bernoulli distribution? Okay, So, essentially, a Bernoulli distributionis the probability distribution Where the variable that we are you know, tracking uh is a binary variable,right? And so what we're saying is the probability of a win is some value theatre, and the probability of not winningis therefore right, And this is essentially a Bernoulli distribution. And we say that we have one parameter, right? So this thing here, the theatre is called a parameter.And what we are saying is that once we have determined that the event that we are tracking here in the dataBernoulli distribution. We have essentially said that there is some kind of functional form. that we have settled on, right? In this case, the functional form. Is this here now? What do we mean by functional form,You know, from maps function something that takes inputs and maps it too. Kind of right. And so here, what we're saying is, given an input which can either be a win or not win, we are wanting to map it onto a, uh, an actual value of probability.Right. So we have decided, because this variable is binary, that the function will be a Bernoulli distribution.Okay, So what we want to do is given some data. this data has been generated by some real world process.where the real world process in our case is a cricket match. right. And in the past, whenever cricket matches have been played between Indiaand Pakistan, we have seen an outcome right and that's the experiences that we have now. On the whole, the outcome of a new cricket match taking place tomorrow is unknown to us.Yeah, right. To make a prediction, however, we need to be able to estimate this particular parameter theatre.actual process that runs in the real world is we have made an assumption that it follows anomaly distribution, and based on that assumption, we have a parameter which is an unknown, and we are basically trying to learn what that value could be. And that's the process of estimation.Yeah, right now, imagine a scenario where your data had 52 wins for India, but you randomly chose theatre to be 0.1.Okay. Now the question is Is this a good model of the real world process? No, no. Why is it not? Because your expectation is that if theatre was truly 0.1 then out of n matches that you watched, you would expect to win.Be once. Yeah, right. But you're actually seeing out of 100 matches. You're saying 52. So you need a way to measurehow good your current estimate of theatre actually is. And in machine learning, we call that a cost function.you know, the the world is an uncertain place and we can think of the probability of a win which takes a value between zero and one. Right. So this probability of it has to be between zero and one. Those are the conditions of probability. But we don't know what that value is before we see any data.Okay, so in a way, what we could say is that the actual value three to itself. which can take values between zero and one. There is an equal probability of any of the values of theatrebeing the right parameter value here. Right before we have seen any data. the Value Theatre could take the value zero where we are saying that India has no chance of ever winning. Or it could take a value of one where we are saying India will always been or somewhere in between the true value of what is the probability in a random match between India and Pakistan? Win. It could be any value in here, right? So we call this a uniform distribution,okay, right. So, in a way, what we're saying is that we started off with what was our prior belief. in theatre, right? And we call that the probability of theatre and we are saying that that's a uniform distribution where every value has an equal. Probert. Now that we have seen the data which will call D,we now say we want to update. this probability, and we call it a posterior probability, okay? where we write it like a conditional probability, given that data exists Now, what is our belief in theatre?This is Yeah. Okay. And what we would say here is that somewhere from this prior belief, we have updated our belief in the distribution of theatre.And given that we have seen these 5th 100 matches, out of which India won 52 we are going to start expecting some kind of a distribution that looks like this,right? We're now kind of getting a much higher probability of theta taking values somewhere between 0.5 and 0.6. Right? So it does have a possibility. Still, because we've only seen 100 matches and remember that a probability isreally defined at the limit way. We've seen lots and lots of frequentist IQ data. Can we be confident that we are converging towards the true likelihood of the true probability of an event? Okay,right. So it's actually what we are trying to do is we start off by having some prior belief in what a parameter value could be. And if we don't have any data, we can assume it's a uniform distributionand then As we get data, we update our belief in theatre and get Earth, um, distribution that has a lower variance in it. Right out here, the variances right across the board here.Whereas now we're saying there is a lesser variance. We know that between maybe 0.4 and 0.6 because we've seen some data. And as we see more data, we keep updating that belief and we get to a point where now we have very low variance, and variance is a bad thing,right? So it's more concentrated that it's more concentrated, right? And so that's what we're saying. So high variance means less knowledge.Right? So the whole idea here in machine learning is about learning some probability distribution using in data that is given to us, which we call training data.right. So we are providing data about experiences that have happened in the past, presuming that we are updating our understanding of various parameter values and we're reducing the uncertainty around what that parameter value could be.Makes sense.

Right? So let's say, are you interested inuh, bet on anybody winning, right, because the possibilities are very similar. So, in effect, what we're doing here is a form of very simple machine learning. We have datathis data is about matches that have been played in the past, right? We're using those experiences so we can think of this data as experiencesfrom which we want to learn. Uh, some information, some knowledge that can help us make decisions. Right.So if we look at data that has a binary outcome like this, you can either win or not win. Do you know, from a probability perspective, what kind of probability distribution This is,um, your own. Have you heard of a Bernoulli distribution? Okay, So, essentially, a Bernoulli distributionis the probability distribution Where the variable that we are you know, tracking uh is a binary variable,right? And so what we're saying is the probability of a win is some value theatre, and the probability of not winningis therefore right, And this is essentially a Bernoulli distribution. And we say that we have one parameter, right? So this thing here, the theatre is called a parameter.And what we are saying is that once we have determined that the event that we are tracking here in the dataBernoulli distribution. We have essentially said that there is some kind of functional form. that we have settled on, right? In this case, the functional form. Is this here now? What do we mean by functional form,You know, from maps function something that takes inputs and maps it too. Kind of right. And so here, what we're saying is, given an input which can either be a win or not win, we are wanting to map it onto a, uh, an actual value of probability.Right. So we have decided, because this variable is binary, that the function will be a Bernoulli distribution.Okay, So what we want to do is given some data. this data has been generated by some real world process.where the real world process in our case is a cricket match. right. And in the past, whenever cricket matches have been played between Indiaand Pakistan, we have seen an outcome right and that's the experiences that we have now. On the whole, the outcome of a new cricket match taking place tomorrow is unknown to us.Yeah, right. To make a prediction, however, we need to be able to estimate this particular parameter theatre.actual process that runs in the real world is we have made an assumption that it follows anomaly distribution, and based on that assumption, we have a parameter which is an unknown, and we are basically trying to learn what that value could be. And that's the process of estimation.Yeah, right now, imagine a scenario where your data had 52 wins for India, but you randomly chose theatre to be 0.1.Okay. Now the question is Is this a good model of the real world process? No, no. Why is it not? Because your expectation is that if theatre was truly 0.1 then out of n matches that you watched, you would expect to win.Be once. Yeah, right. But you're actually seeing out of 100 matches. You're saying 52. So you need a way to measurehow good your current estimate of theatre actually is. And in machine learning, we call that a cost function.you know, the the world is an uncertain place and we can think of the probability of a win which takes a value between zero and one. Right. So this probability of it has to be between zero and one. Those are the conditions of probability. But we don't know what that value is before we see any data.Okay, so in a way, what we could say is that the actual value three to itself. which can take values between zero and one. There is an equal probability of any of the values of theatrebeing the right parameter value here. Right before we have seen any data. the Value Theatre could take the value zero where we are saying that India has no chance of ever winning. Or it could take a value of one where we are saying India will always been or somewhere in between the true value of what is the probability in a random match between India and Pakistan? Win. It could be any value in here, right? So we call this a uniform distribution,okay, right. So, in a way, what we're saying is that we started off with what was our prior belief. in theatre, right? And we call that the probability of theatre and we are saying that that's a uniform distribution where every value has an equal. Probert. Now that we have seen the data which will call D,we now say we want to update. this probability, and we call it a posterior probability, okay? where we write it like a conditional probability, given that data exists Now, what is our belief in theatre?This is Yeah. Okay. And what we would say here is that somewhere from this prior belief, we have updated our belief in the distribution of theatre.And given that we have seen these 5th 100 matches, out of which India won 52 we are going to start expecting some kind of a distribution that looks like this,right? We're now kind of getting a much higher probability of theta taking values somewhere between 0.5 and 0.6. Right? So it does have a possibility. Still, because we've only seen 100 matches and remember that a probability isreally defined at the limit way. We've seen lots and lots of frequentist IQ data. Can we be confident that we are converging towards the true likelihood of the true probability of an event? Okay,right. So it's actually what we are trying to do is we start off by having some prior belief in what a parameter value could be. And if we don't have any data, we can assume it's a uniform distributionand then As we get data, we update our belief in theatre and get Earth, um, distribution that has a lower variance in it. Right out here, the variances right across the board here.Whereas now we're saying there is a lesser variance. We know that between maybe 0.4 and 0.6 because we've seen some data. And as we see more data, we keep updating that belief and we get to a point where now we have very low variance, and variance is a bad thing,right? So it's more concentrated that it's more concentrated, right? And so that's what we're saying. So high variance means less knowledge.Right? So the whole idea here in machine learning is about learning some probability distribution using in data that is given to us, which we call training data.right. So we are providing data about experiences that have happened in the past, presuming that we are updating our understanding of various parameter values and we're reducing the uncertainty around what that parameter value could be.Makes sense.

So that determines the capacityand er It also includes things like, you know, complexity of the storey, and also it's like if it is a very complex storey, then definitely the storey point is more and so that's the reason the efficiency or the, you know work hours will be more and if it is a a medium or lesser complex than definitely the number of our covers required will be lives. So everything of this we take into consideration along witha, for example, a team member out of 15 days. Or to explain that the stand a strength, he will be only for the next two days or last two days. Whatever. Okay, so his effective days will be around eight days, right? So they'll also consider that that okay, he is actually available for eight days, and according to its, his work hours will be calculated.So So this is telling that and then add up the individual capacity to calculate the team's overall capacity. So the complete work covers for each of the team members in adding of all each team members complete work hours. We can make the full capacity of the T right that aghast on your team's overall capacity, which is maximum amount of work that you can pile on their plate before you have over extended them, which we don't want.So this is the basic things are going forward with some more points on capacity planning. It's like on tapestry. Planning helps the team understand the amount of productive engineering time available in a sprint. For example, To perform capacity planning for energy team, you must gather each teammembers availability and time of, as I said regarding their holidays or leaves, you know, I said about the leaves. If there is holidays during those springtime, then definitely we also considered that. And that time of will be for everybody.

That's very will prioritise task and scheduled those hours so that work is completed by the intended deadline. So capacity means you will root the project plan expectations in reality. So we are not keeping anything for, you know, guess work rather than you're optimistic guesses about what team can churn. Oh, this is the basic thing about capacity. The next comes the ways to estimate so.if a some of you guys are working currently on sprint based projects or even if you are not, I think you must be familiar with things like estimation of the storeys. So how do we do the estimates? So the most common thing that we currently laid to is Storey pointing right?So this is just a just in which I am trying to explain to Otis Storey pointing. So there are a couple of methods that we tried to estimate there's old school, May 3rd storey point, May 3rd storey count and hybrid matters. The most common method is the storey appointments or which we normally deal in storey pointing. Also, there are two ways of Storey pointing that this T shirt sizing and the Fibonacci series oneso again a T shirt sizing, which is like small, medium large Axl, this is not that much used and the Fib Unity series, which is the most commonly used currently on storey pointing.So how is this done? For example? It's a very simple storey and we do not have anything to explore or lots of understanding. Then it will be a storey 0.1 or two, so here. The series is given of it wrong. And sorry I didn't cheque that out. It will be one told 357 notches. Cities. Okay, so if it is a simple one will give a one or two pointers.that a storey pointing is done along with the whole team. As you know, there are grooming sessions during which the whole team sits together, understands the storey and then, as per everybody is voting that is decided whether that storeys and easy one then will give an auto. If it is a medium complex storey will give it a three if it is more complex than it is a five and if it is extremely complicated and very, very difficult will give it eight.So most of the times we tried to break down eight point of storeys into lesser points. Like, you know, two models of three and five. Okay, one storey of three points, another of five points. So body A.

So how we are putting a tear in the simple largest explained to him So these are the name of the resources that are part of those Graham.So although people are names are written one other work days for which, for example, this is showing that it is a to experience that why that's why it is 10 days. Okay, In the two weeks we have 10 days, then we have categorised each type of work. Okay, so here you can see the availablenumber of days. Okay, So for example, this person don't have any vacation or anything else. So that's why he is completely available for all the 10 days and his complete work hours is 7010 into seven sewing plans. Seven hours. I am sorrysomething is here in miss Okay, He So we are considering here seven work hours per day. That's the reason we're have given a den into 7. 3070 of us.

It's nine into seven. That is an an hours per day of her, which comes to 63. So in this way, all the team's effort or work hours is calculated, and the total comes to around 3 15 hours.So this is a basic capacity plan, so I'll just give you a glimpse of the actual ones, which we normally use, so it's a bit more complicated than what you have seen, so", 'keywords': ['Capacity Planning', 'Resource Availability', 'Work Hours'], 'summary': 'The transcript discusses capacity planning techniques, specifically highlighting a simple table used for capacity planning.

So the benefit of this is that you know, we are not keeping anything for, you know, like Cobb, depending on the chance of completion. It's like a sure shot. What they are projecting, what they are planning, what we are focusing, we are able to achieve it. So that is the main benefit of compactD planning. When we do capacity planning in a proper weight and there is very less chance that the gold will be missed or, you know, the maximum among the work we are able to achieve, rather than if we are not doing any capacity planning and randomly taking into work the new know Most of the time it's like we miss on the target and there are storeys which will spill over and you know there will be a chaos with industry.of more like the developer. How much hours they spend? The tester, How much I was Davis pen And how much is the total hours? So accordingly you know, open the Pakis parking on this storey as well as this storey as well as this Storey said the complete fire cover should come to near about 36 so we can keep a track. Okay Addition of all these storeys will come to around 36 right? So you can get the totally here.So next comes is the advantages of capacity planning. So I want to just zoom out. You can get a you. so so for the advantages. So first of all, it is avoid burnout. So what is about team won out is like, you know, the Arges piling work on somebody. And we exactly do not have any idea that whether that person will be able to do or not, or whether he is stretching more just to, you know, fulfil the work and to awe do not want want to stumped him to function like that. We want the work to be done. But also it's not like a person is, you know, working late nights and weekends just to compete. We do not one that can be a planning properly,and we are able to estimate that. Okay, we have a delivery in the state. And so if they are planning in this way, our definitely will meet our posts will meet her deliberated. So this will help to do the work effectively without any stress on the team bus. It is the main thing, like so taking steps to get for understanding of your teams at Children positive in she won't overwhelm them with too many tasks and responsibilities and also support them in managing their time by prioritising the most impactful.then sent more realistic deadlines again the same thing. So it's like something which they can achieve. It's not like a career piling them on, and then at the end of the strength of, even if they are trying their level best, they are not able to achieve so Yah, we do not want that. So get details about availability straight from your team. You will get a much needed reality. Cheques on the Dugan manage deadline expectations according to what your team can actually produce,then the third point is identify skin sock shortages. So by evaluating your team's capacity and planning work in advance, it's easier to spot if projects require skills that your team doesn't have. Accounting for that early allows you to take proactive action, such as training someone on your team. Outsourcing attacks are changing the scope of the project, so I think this is very self explanatory. So when we are planning ahead, so we in.So what is the You know what is lacking and what will blockers in achieving our booths? All this identification will not come once we have jumped into the sprint, so it will come before you have actually taken the work, so you can project it and you can, you know, avoid that.

It's actually not three hours. It's actually five hours.

So this type of difficulty comes.And so that's why it is written. It's tough to understand band with, and though we have a solution to this, which is like the always came buffer hours, as I told you so, that that will take care of this and the gritty or whatever. So your team's bandits is always evolving as projects change and team members leave or join the ranks. So this is another challenge, right? Because, you know, team members are leaving and joining in the middle of this print and also that definitely impacts it.So plus, you need to rely on people's honesty about the current again. The same thing as I told a work may take more a work may take less. So that is also restriction all of that making a challenging to get a firm grasp on just how much capacity your team has available to tackle new work and request, particularly if you have a team full of high achievers always believed that they can takemore. Okay, the more often you have, you talked your team about their most three teams to it weekly, the easier it will get for you to be realist. So as an venue work with a certain team. You know, maybe in the first print your capacity may not be a perfect, but as and when you work on a multiple sprints, you know, like erafter first a Ken than third and consecutive sprint. Then you get the more better grasp on how much each person's capacities is. And if you were, you know, if you are committing more than that, also can district or if you are committing less than also that also you can increase it, so we will get a more realistic idea. Changes will throw you off track. They're gonna risk associated with them.The project and enforcement circumstances, from sense in seasonality to industry changes, will throw wrenches senior plans when you need to try to account for all these potentials. At best, capacity planning isn't always so straight forward. Planning in a cushion, even if it's just an extra day or two, will help you roll with the punches without things running of Paris.

So, according to the definition that is given here, is capacity planning is the process of identifying how many hours a project or task will require too demanding whether or not your team has the available bans it to complete it and then coordinating that work for maximum efficiency. So what it exactly means is instead offer. You know, I'm just guessing that how much offer can be done.", 'start_time': '00:00:22', 'end_time': '00:00:52'}, {'Topic': 'Capacity Planning Process', 'transcript': "Capacity planning is a complete process in which we are actually identifying the number of work hours that a person on already member in the scrum team can put in and the maximum work that can be achieved with within the spring time frame. For example, if it is a two week spent, then what is the maximum number of effective work hours that each of the resource can give? So that determines the capacityand er It also includes things like, you know, complexity of the storey, and also it's like if it is a very complex storey, then definitely the storey point is more and so that's the reason the efficiency or the, you know work hours will be more and if it is a a medium or lesser complex than definitely the number of our covers required will be lives. So everything of this we take into consideration along witha, for example, a team member out of 15 days. Or to explain that the stand a strength, he will be only for the next two days or last two days. Whatever. Okay, so his effective days will be around eight days, right? So they'll also consider that that okay, he is actually available for eight days, and according to its, his work hours will be calculated.So So this is telling that and then add up the individual capacity to calculate the team's overall capacity. So the complete work covers for each of the team members in adding of all each team members complete work hours. We can make the full capacity of the T right that aghast on your team's overall capacity, which is maximum amount of work that you can pile on their plate before you have over extended them, which we don't want.So this is the basic things are going forward with some more points on capacity planning. It's like on tapestry. Planning helps the team understand the amount of productive engineering time available in a sprint. For example, To perform capacity planning for energy team, you must gather each teammembers availability and time of, as I said regarding their holidays or leaves, you know, I said about the leaves. If there is holidays during those springtime, then definitely we also considered that. And that time of will be for everybody. That is part of the strength.", 'start_time': '00:00:52', 'end_time': '00:03:30'}, {'Topic': 'Estimating Work Hours', 'transcript': "So once you have that information, you move into the planning stage. That's very will prioritise task and scheduled those hours so that work is completed by the intended deadline. So capacity means you will root the project plan expectations in reality. So we are not keeping anything for, you know, guess work rather than you're optimistic guesses about what team can churn. Oh, this is the basic thing about capacity. The next comes the ways to estimate so.if a some of you guys are working currently on sprint based projects or even if you are not, I think you must be familiar with things like estimation of the storeys. So how do we do the estimates? So the most common thing that we currently laid to is Storey pointing right?So this is just a just in which I am trying to explain to Otis Storey pointing. So there are a couple of methods that we tried to estimate there's old school, May 3rd storey point, May 3rd storey count and hybrid matters. The most common method is the storey appointments or which we normally deal in storey pointing. Also, there are two ways of Storey pointing that this T shirt sizing and the Fibonacci series oneso again a T shirt sizing, which is like small, medium large Axl, this is not that much used and the Fib Unity series, which is the most commonly used currently on storey pointing.So how is this done? For example? It's a very simple storey and we do not have anything to explore or lots of understanding. Then it will be a storey 0.1 or two, so here. The series is given of it wrong. And sorry I didn't cheque that out. It will be one told 357 notches. Cities. Okay, so if it is a simple one will give a one or two pointers.that a storey pointing is done along with the whole team. As you know, there are grooming sessions during which the whole team sits together, understands the storey and then, as per everybody is voting that is decided whether that storeys and easy one then will give an auto. If it is a medium complex storey will give it a three if it is more complex than it is a five and if it is extremely complicated and very, very difficult will give it eight.So most of the times we tried to break down eight point of storeys into lesser points. Like, you know, two models of three and five. Okay, one storey of three points, another of five points. So body A. This is the way of just, you know, deciding which storey is of how much difficulty level", 'start_time': '00:03:58', 'end_time': '00:06:37'}, {'Topic': 'Capacity Planning Techniques', 'transcript': "So this is just a rough or in a very simple what can is it? A table which is showing how we are doing the capacity planning, though in other real instance are in show you how it issues showing. So the normally we have two ways of doing this capacity planning.Either we do we have a template of Axl shit temperate in which we put in the work hours or else we can donate directly through. So how we are putting a tear in the simple largest explained to him So these are the name of the resources that are part of those Graham.So although people are names are written one other work days for which, for example, this is showing that it is a to experience that why that's why it is 10 days. Okay, In the two weeks we have 10 days, then we have categorised each type of work. Okay, so here you can see the availablenumber of days. Okay, So for example, this person don't have any vacation or anything else. So that's why he is completely available for all the 10 days and his complete work hours is 7010 into seven sewing plans. Seven hours. I am sorrysomething is here in miss Okay, He So we are considering here seven work hours per day. That's the reason we're have given a den into 7. 3070 of us. Okay, then the second person, as you can see here, he has a vacation of one day. Right? So that's the reason his effective days is only nine.And hence the calculation that is coming. It's nine into seven. That is an an hours per day of her, which comes to 63. So in this way, all the team's effort or work hours is calculated, and the total comes to around 3 15 hours.So this is a basic capacity plan, so I'll just give you a glimpse of the actual ones, which we normally use, so it's a bit more complicated than what you have seen, so", 'start_time': '00:06:40', 'end_time': '00:08:49'}, {'Topic': 'Benefits of Capacity Planning', 'transcript': "So what is the benefit of this? So the benefit of this is that you know, we are not keeping anything for, you know, like Cobb, depending on the chance of completion. It's like a sure shot. What they are projecting, what they are planning, what we are focusing, we are able to achieve it. So that is the main benefit of compactD planning. When we do capacity planning in a proper weight and there is very less chance that the gold will be missed or, you know, the maximum among the work we are able to achieve, rather than if we are not doing any capacity planning and randomly taking into work the new know Most of the time it's like we miss on the target and there are storeys which will spill over and you know there will be a chaos with industry.of more like the developer. How much hours they spend? The tester, How much I was Davis pen And how much is the total hours? So accordingly you know, open the Pakis parking on this storey as well as this storey as well as this Storey said the complete fire cover should come to near about 36 so we can keep a track. Okay Addition of all these storeys will come to around 36 right? So you can get the totally here.So next comes is the advantages of capacity planning. So I want to just zoom out. You can get a you. so so for the advantages. So first of all, it is avoid burnout. So what is about team won out is like, you know, the Arges piling work on somebody. And we exactly do not have any idea that whether that person will be able to do or not, or whether he is stretching more just to, you know, fulfil the work and to awe do not want want to stumped him to function like that. We want the work to be done. But also it's not like a person is, you know, working late nights and weekends just to compete. We do not one that can be a planning properly,and we are able to estimate that. Okay, we have a delivery in the state. And so if they are planning in this way, our definitely will meet our posts will meet her deliberated. So this will help to do the work effectively without any stress on the team bus. It is the main thing, like so taking steps to get for understanding of your teams at Children positive in she won't overwhelm them with too many tasks and responsibilities and also support them in managing their time by prioritising the most impactful.then sent more realistic deadlines again the same thing. So it's like something which they can achieve. It's not like a career piling them on, and then at the end of the strength of, even if they are trying their level best, they are not able to achieve so Yah, we do not want that. So get details about availability straight from your team. You will get a much needed reality. Cheques on the Dugan manage deadline expectations according to what your team can actually produce,then the third point is identify skin sock shortages. So by evaluating your team's capacity and planning work in advance, it's easier to spot if projects require skills that your team doesn't have. Accounting for that early allows you to take proactive action, such as training someone on your team. Outsourcing attacks are changing the scope of the project, so I think this is very self explanatory. So when we are planning ahead, so we in.So what is the You know what is lacking and what will blockers in achieving our booths? All this identification will not come once we have jumped into the sprint, so it will come before you have actually taken the work, so you can project it and you can, you know, avoid that. And whatever you are committing, you will be able to deliver. That's the most important thing, right?", 'start_time': '00:02:15', 'end_time': '00:20:01'}, {'Topic': 'Challenges in Capacity Planning', 'transcript': "so the challenges of capacity planning said stuff to understand band with. So, yeah, it is tough to understand band with because, you know, view we are projecting that. Okay, this person can do this much hours. It may be that Okay, that person, even if for he is mentioning that I will need three hours of world,Sometimes something happens and he is getting stuck and he needs another more two hours. It's actually not three hours. It's actually five hours. So in that way, when we are calculating everything we are considering, Okay, this work will only take three hours, but actually it is taking more. So this type of difficulty comes.And so that's why it is written. It's tough to understand band with, and though we have a solution to this, which is like the always came buffer hours, as I told you so, that that will take care of this and the gritty or whatever. So your team's bandits is always evolving as projects change and team members leave or join the ranks. So this is another challenge, right? Because, you know, team members are leaving and joining in the middle of this print and also that definitely impacts it.So plus, you need to rely on people's honesty about the current again. The same thing as I told a work may take more a work may take less. So that is also restriction all of that making a challenging to get a firm grasp on just how much capacity your team has available to tackle new work and request, particularly if you have a team full of high achievers always believed that they can takemore. Okay, the more often you have, you talked your team about their most three teams to it weekly, the easier it will get for you to be realist. So as an venue work with a certain team. You know, maybe in the first print your capacity may not be a perfect, but as and when you work on a multiple sprints, you know, like erafter first a Ken than third and consecutive sprint. Then you get the more better grasp on how much each person's capacities is. And if you were, you know, if you are committing more than that, also can district or if you are committing less than also that also you can increase it, so we will get a more realistic idea. Changes will throw you off track. They're gonna risk associated with them.The project and enforcement circumstances, from sense in seasonality to industry changes, will throw wrenches senior plans when you need to try to account for all these potentials. At best, capacity planning isn't always so straight forward. Planning in a cushion, even if it's just an extra day or two, will help you roll with the punches without things running of Paris. So again, this is something it it is likeeven if you are planning, there may be some hindrances, but you know it's much better to go with capacity than without capacity.

This is a part of capacity and a tapestry. Planning is only useful if you though something with the information you identify that can involve turning down projects due to lack of bandwidth, adjusting a reducing expectations, pushing out deadlines. It's always better to say no than too serious and not to deliver. So this is the most inPorton part, you know. So capacity planning is for this reason only that you know what you are committing. You should be able to deliver. And if you you are saying like you are able to predict that, Okay, if this much of a commitment I'm giving, I will not be able to deliver than it's better to mention that beforehand rather than taking that one and then not delivering.

Okay, so this is the main our thing, you know, and a capacity in the first sprint that Udo will never be perfect. It will be a kind of Okay,we are just trying to see. But as and when the A growth, the capacity planning for the future strengths on the next prince will definitely be better and will have a better idea about the amount of work which we should take and will be able to complete.

Simple planning and dependency management features help your team's visualise and manage work better. So what is exactly a roadmap is nothing but a planning feature in bet.

As I said, like a feature, you there is a feature. Okay, So if that feature is a small feature, if it is a big feature than again, features will be broken down. But if it is a small features that you can't convert into an epic,so just you will create an epic, and underneath it you will again create storeys of that in order to achieve that feature, what other things you need to what other steps you need to do border the storeys that need to be turning out to create that feature in order to complete that feature. So that is epics. So as again, as I said to you, So these are the epics, this whatever icon you are saying in the left, those are epic aiglons.and these are, though, things depicted in coloured bars. what is a child issue again?

Is is there a way of I can see what we estimated and what weactually you ST road map you can see Like, for example, you are saying that it is epically an audible to complete by the time we haveestimated the an audible to complete rate. So then again you have to bow and I manually changing, told the due date that we have right. Then you will be able to see the actual it.

You know, if you something happened and you are not able to complete on the mention time or whatever time the timeframe has registered or shifted. So then you can definitely change the start in. And when work is assigned to team members in Gina, they can easily see how theywork ladders up to epics. Okay, so, yes.

Estimation methods, particularly story pointing, are discussed, highlighting techniques like T-shirt sizing and the Fibonacci series for task complexity assessment. A simple table for capacity planning is introduced, alongside methods for categorizing resources based on availability, which impacts total effective work hours.\n\nThe benefits of capacity planning in project management are emphasized, including avoiding team burnout and ensuring realistic task distribution. Challenges such as accurately estimating team bandwidth and dynamic team composition are addressed, with a focus on the necessity of regular communication and buffer time in planning. Best practices highlight the importance of transparency and realistic project commitments.\n\nThe session also delves into roadmap planning, explaining its role in organizing large projects and managing features and epics. The creation of a roadmap involves visual representation of tasks, start and due dates, and managing dependencies that can impact project execution. The discussion covers tracking and reporting on roadmaps, emphasizing the need for regular updates to maintain alignment with actual progress.\n\nA roadmap creation tool within the software 'Gina' is detailed, including features for sharing, exporting, and managing projects. Collaboration between product owners and team members is deemed essential for effective roadmap creation. The session concludes with a summary and an invitation for questions, along with a note on feedback and additional materials related to the topics discussed."}

So, according to the definition that is given here, is capacity planning is the process of identifying how many hours a project or task will require too demanding whether or not your team has the available bans it to complete it and then coordinating that work for maximum efficiency. So what it exactly means is instead offer. You know, I'm just guessing that how much offer can be done.Capacity planning is a complete process in which we are actually identifying the number of work hours that a person on already member in the scrum team can put in and the maximum work that can be achieved with within the spring time frame. For example, if it is a two week spent, then what is the maximum number of effective work hours that each of the resource can give? So that determines the capacityand er It also includes things like, you know, complexity of the storey, and also it's like if it is a very complex storey, then definitely the storey point is more and so that's the reason the efficiency or the, you know work hours will be more and if it is a a medium or lesser complex than definitely the number of our covers required will be lives. So everything of this we take into consideration along witha, for example, a team member out of 15 days. Or to explain that the stand a strength, he will be only for the next two days or last two days. Whatever. Okay, so his effective days will be around eight days, right? So they'll also consider that that okay, he is actually available for eight days, and according to its, his work hours will be calculated.So what is the benefit of this? So the benefit of this is that you know, we are not keeping anything for, you know, like Cobb, depending on the chance of completion. It's like a sure shot. What they are projecting, what they are planning, what we are focusing, we are able to achieve it. So that is the main benefit of compactD planning. When we do capacity planning in a proper weight and there is very less chance that the gold will be missed or, you know, the maximum among the work we are able to achieve, rather than if we are not doing any capacity planning and randomly taking into work the new know Most of the time it's like we miss on the target and there are storeys which will spill over and you know there will be a chaos with industry.So this is the basic things are going forward with some more points on capacity planning. It's like on tapestry. Planning helps the team understand the amount of productive engineering time available in a sprint. For example, To perform capacity planning for energy team, you must gather each teammembers availability and time of, as I said regarding their holidays or leaves, you know, I said about the leaves. If there is holidays during those springtime, then definitely we also considered that. And that time of will be for everybody. That is part of the strength.So So this is telling that and then add up the individual capacity to calculate the team's overall capacity. So the complete work covers for each of the team members in adding of all each team members complete work hours. We can make the full capacity of the T right that aghast on your team's overall capacity, which is maximum amount of work that you can pile on their plate before you have over extended them, which we don't want.", 'keywords': ['Capacity Planning', 'Sprint', 'Scrum Team', 'Work Hours', 'Task Complexity', 'Team Capacity'], 'summary': 'The transcript discusses the capacity planning process, defining it as a method for determining the number of hours required for a project or task and assessing whether a team has the necessary bandwidth to complete it efficiently.

The speaker highlights the need to consider individual availability, including holidays and leaves, to calculate the overall team capacity.

That's very will prioritise task and scheduled those hours so that work is completed by the intended deadline. So capacity means you will root the project plan expectations in reality. So we are not keeping anything for, you know, guess work rather than you're optimistic guesses about what team can churn. Oh, this is the basic thing about capacity. The next comes the ways to estimate so.if a some of you guys are working currently on sprint based projects or even if you are not, I think you must be familiar with things like estimation of the storeys. So how do we do the estimates? So the most common thing that we currently laid to is Storey pointing right?So this is just a just in which I am trying to explain to Otis Storey pointing. So there are a couple of methods that we tried to estimate there's old school, May 3rd storey point, May 3rd storey count and hybrid matters. The most common method is the storey appointments or which we normally deal in storey pointing. Also, there are two ways of Storey pointing that this T shirt sizing and the Fibonacci series oneso again a T shirt sizing, which is like small, medium large Axl, this is not that much used and the Fib Unity series, which is the most commonly used currently on storey pointing.So how is this done? For example? It's a very simple storey and we do not have anything to explore or lots of understanding. Then it will be a storey 0.1 or two, so here. The series is given of it wrong. And sorry I didn't cheque that out. It will be one told 357 notches. Cities. Okay, so if it is a simple one will give a one or two pointers.that a storey pointing is done along with the whole team. As you know, there are grooming sessions during which the whole team sits together, understands the storey and then, as per everybody is voting that is decided whether that storeys and easy one then will give an auto. If it is a medium complex storey will give it a three if it is more complex than it is a five and if it is extremely complicated and very, very difficult will give it eight.So most of the times we tried to break down eight point of storeys into lesser points. Like, you know, two models of three and five. Okay, one storey of three points, another of five points. So body A. This is the way of just, you know, deciding which storey is of how much difficulty level", 'keywords': ['Capacity Estimation', 'Project Management', 'Story Pointing', 'Agile', 'T-shirt Sizing', 'Fibonacci Series'], 'summary': 'The transcript discusses capacity estimation techniques in project management, emphasizing the importance of planning and realistic expectations for project timelines.

So the normally we have two ways of doing this capacity planning.Either we do we have a template of Axl shit temperate in which we put in the work hours or else we can donate directly through. So how we are putting a tear in the simple largest explained to him So these are the name of the resources that are part of those Graham.So although people are names are written one other work days for which, for example, this is showing that it is a to experience that why that's why it is 10 days. Okay, In the two weeks we have 10 days, then we have categorised each type of work. Okay, so here you can see the availablenumber of days. Okay, So for example, this person don't have any vacation or anything else. So that's why he is completely available for all the 10 days and his complete work hours is 7010 into seven sewing plans. Seven hours. I am sorrysomething is here in miss Okay, He So we are considering here seven work hours per day. That's the reason we're have given a den into 7. 3070 of us. Okay, then the second person, as you can see here, he has a vacation of one day. Right? So that's the reason his effective days is only nine.And hence the calculation that is coming. It's nine into seven. That is an an hours per day of her, which comes to 63. So in this way, all the team's effort or work hours is calculated, and the total comes to around 3 15 hours.So this is a basic capacity plan, so I'll just give you a glimpse of the actual ones, which we normally use, so it's a bit more complicated than what you have seen, so", 'keywords': ['Capacity Planning', 'Work Hours', 'Resources', 'Vacation', 'Effective Days'], 'summary': 'The transcript discusses the basics of capacity planning tools, specifically highlighting a simple table used for tracking work hours.

So this is actually some sort of a real life capacity planning sheet that we are actually using. So it's a bit more complex than what I show new as a unit sister format, you can seeSo here you can say everything is mentioned. Who are the team members? What are the total number of this string shot is not full. So because I couldn't take it in a single stream. So there are some more few more members the chairman sing here. So this is train shot with, I mean part of the scrum team, not the full. As you can see from here, all the members are being seenso here that the members are there. So total spring daisy A mentioning water, the holidays. If there is any any leads for any of the resources, what on the actual days. So what are the actual days means what at the days that they are actually working per day hours. So here we have taken six tapesix hours per day and we keep two hours for buffer. Usually that is assigned because, you know, we do have several meetings when we are part of the sprint or a scam. We have several meetings. So that's why be assigned belief to ask per day for this kind of activities, meeting activities and other, you know.Connexion, connecting with the your team members and also effective work hours.

Okay, so yeah, along that we have a few more things, like, you know, what is the available capacity? What is the time estimate and capacity utilisation. Capacity remaining. So, for example, a person has 36 capacity. But as per the storey points, we are able to assign only 30 work hours, so he will have a remaining capacity of 5% or fivein which he can accommodate any ad host stance or anything that comes in between.

And similarly, the addition of all these people that are in grade are the other deaf people. So the damper cars were able to calculate separately, and then we have the total bar covers. But yeah, this thing, whatever is the total, is it? It's coming here and we're getting the total were covers for Q and the for deaf and also for the team, So this is the way so.some of them things like. so long. Also, you know, though, didn't use this one much, but sometimes also from this. whatever data we are giving, we can also culprit velocity here. Or we can project the velocity that we will be able to achieve, okay?sahib. department in this manually, or is it through the era? So I am telling youth of this Excel sheet is actually mental manually. But we do have a G option of it doesn't happen like this. I will show you the gene option as after we have discussed. So I told him in to his red wine, raise the Excel sheet, which is a manual thing, which we do right. This is the one and also may have a Gina option which have issued.Sorry, Mon Amis. However question So withdrawing the screen on the right hand side where you have listed down the storey numbers and the name of the other way of doing the capacity Planning, however, know like this is the same capacity. So here now we are register jotting down the storeys that will be covering in the spread ride for every sprint before starting the spring. We aredoing a capacity planning, right? So the upcoming streamed We are listing down all the storeys that we will do in this train. And who will work on this print. Right? So for example, if this storey is being done by the developer Dipak So the package will have here his workouts. How many work of us even allocated? For example, out of his total capacity of 36 he will just give three hours for this. And then again there will besome Barca was for the tested as well they will give. Maybe they will give two hours. Okay, so that is the reason the invention ing it. Storey buys how much a storey points or how much Barca will not store ippon. Sorry hours breakdown actually right at the breakdown and the the task, right? Completely a ride. So every storeys we are breaking down. We're taking the hours considering the hours that will beof more like the developer. How much hours they spend? The tester, How much I was Davis pen And how much is the total hours? So accordingly you know, open the Pakis parking on this storey as well as this storey as well as this Storey said the complete fire cover should come to near about 36 so we can keep a track. Okay Addition of all these storeys will come to around 36 right? So you can get the totally here.So next comes is the advantages of capacity planning. So I want to just zoom out. You can get a you. so so for the advantages. So first of all, it is avoid burnout. So what is about team won out is like, you know, the Arges piling work on somebody. And we exactly do not have any idea that whether that person will be able to do or not, or whether he is stretching more just to, you know, fulfil the work and to awe do not want want to stumped him to function like that. We want the work to be done. But also it's not like a person is, you know, working late nights and weekends just to compete. We do not one that can be a planning properly,and we are able to estimate that. Okay, we have a delivery in the state. And so if they are planning in this way, our definitely will meet our posts will meet her deliberated. So this will help to do the work effectively without any stress on the team bus. It is the main thing, like so taking steps to get for understanding of your teams at Children positive in she won't overwhelm them with too many tasks and responsibilities and also support them in managing their time by prioritising the most impactful.then sent more realistic deadlines again the same thing. So it's like something which they can achieve. It's not like a career piling them on, and then at the end of the strength of, even if they are trying their level best, they are not able to achieve so Yah, we do not want that. So get details about availability straight from your team. You will get a much needed reality. Cheques on the Dugan manage deadline expectations according to what your team can actually produce,then the third point is identify skin sock shortages. So by evaluating your team's capacity and planning work in advance, it's easier to spot if projects require skills that your team doesn't have. Accounting for that early allows you to take proactive action, such as training someone on your team. Outsourcing attacks are changing the scope of the project, so I think this is very self explanatory. So when we are planning ahead, so we in.So what is the You know what is lacking and what will blockers in achieving our booths? All this identification will not come once we have jumped into the sprint, so it will come before you have actually taken the work, so you can project it and you can, you know, avoid that. And whatever you are committing, you will be able to deliver. That's the most important thing, right?so the challenges of capacity planning said stuff to understand band with. So, yeah, it is tough to understand band with because, you know, view we are projecting that. Okay, this person can do this much hours. It may be that Okay, that person, even if for he is mentioning that I will need three hours of world,Sometimes something happens and he is getting stuck and he needs another more two hours. It's actually not three hours. It's actually five hours. So in that way, when we are calculating everything we are considering, Okay, this work will only take three hours, but actually it is taking more. So this type of difficulty comes.And so that's why it is written. It's tough to understand band with, and though we have a solution to this, which is like the always came buffer hours, as I told you so, that that will take care of this and the gritty or whatever. So your team's bandits is always evolving as projects change and team members leave or join the ranks. So this is another challenge, right? Because, you know, team members are leaving and joining in the middle of this print and also that definitely impacts it.So plus, you need to rely on people's honesty about the current again. The same thing as I told a work may take more a work may take less. So that is also restriction all of that making a challenging to get a firm grasp on just how much capacity your team has available to tackle new work and request, particularly if you have a team full of high achievers always believed that they can takemore. Okay, the more often you have, you talked your team about their most three teams to it weekly, the easier it will get for you to be realist. So as an venue work with a certain team. You know, maybe in the first print your capacity may not be a perfect, but as and when you work on a multiple sprints, you know, like erafter first a Ken than third and consecutive sprint. Then you get the more better grasp on how much each person's capacities is. And if you were, you know, if you are committing more than that, also can district or if you are committing less than also that also you can increase it, so we will get a more realistic idea. Changes will throw you off track. They're gonna risk associated with them.The project and enforcement circumstances, from sense in seasonality to industry changes, will throw wrenches senior plans when you need to try to account for all these potentials. At best, capacity planning isn't always so straight forward. Planning in a cushion, even if it's just an extra day or two, will help you roll with the punches without things running of Paris. So again, this is something it it is likeeven if you are planning, there may be some hindrances, but you know it's much better to go with capacity than without capacity. Then it is like completely chaos, andthere is no planning and all if you're doing any, you know, starting or sprint without the capacity, so you will have to engage in some hard conversations again. This is a part of capacity and a tapestry.

It's always better to say no than too serious and not to deliver. So this is the most inPorton part, you know. So capacity planning is for this reason only that you know what you are committing. You should be able to deliver.

So, according to the definition that is given here, is capacity planning is the process of identifying how many hours a project or task will require too demanding whether or not your team has the available bans it to complete it and then coordinating that work for maximum efficiency. So what it exactly means is instead offer. You know, I'm just guessing that how much offer can be done.Capacity planning is a complete process in which we are actually identifying the number of work hours that a person on already member in the scrum team can put in and the maximum work that can be achieved with within the spring time frame. For example, if it is a two week spent, then what is the maximum number of effective work hours that each of the resource can give? So that determines the capacityand er It also includes things like, you know, complexity of the storey, and also it's like if it is a very complex storey, then definitely the storey point is more and so that's the reason the efficiency or the, you know work hours will be more and if it is a a medium or lesser complex than definitely the number of our covers required will be lives. So everything of this we take into consideration along witha, for example, a team member out of 15 days. Or to explain that the stand a strength, he will be only for the next two days or last two days. Whatever. Okay, so his effective days will be around eight days, right? So they'll also consider that that okay, he is actually available for eight days, and according to its, his work hours will be calculated.So what is the benefit of this? So the benefit of this is that you know, we are not keeping anything for, you know, like Cobb, depending on the chance of completion. It's like a sure shot. What they are projecting, what they are planning, what we are focusing, we are able to achieve it. So that is the main benefit of compactD planning. When we do capacity planning in a proper weight and there is very less chance that the gold will be missed or, you know, the maximum among the work we are able to achieve, rather than if we are not doing any capacity planning and randomly taking into work the new know Most of the time it's like we miss on the target and there are storeys which will spill over and you know there will be a chaos with industry.So this is the basic things are going forward with some more points on capacity planning. It's like on tapestry. Planning helps the team understand the amount of productive engineering time available in a sprint. For example, To perform capacity planning for energy team, you must gather each teammembers availability and time of, as I said regarding their holidays or leaves, you know, I said about the leaves. If there is holidays during those springtime, then definitely we also considered that. And that time of will be for everybody. That is part of the strength.So So this is telling that and then add up the individual capacity to calculate the team's overall capacity. So the complete work covers for each of the team members in adding of all each team members complete work hours. We can make the full capacity of the T right that aghast on your team's overall capacity, which is maximum amount of work that you can pile on their plate before you have over extended them, which we don't want.", 'start_time': '00:00:22', 'end_time': '00:03:58'}, {'Topic': 'Capacity Estimation Techniques', 'transcript': "So once you have that information, you move into the planning stage. That's very will prioritise task and scheduled those hours so that work is completed by the intended deadline. So capacity means you will root the project plan expectations in reality. So we are not keeping anything for, you know, guess work rather than you're optimistic guesses about what team can churn. Oh, this is the basic thing about capacity. The next comes the ways to estimate so.if a some of you guys are working currently on sprint based projects or even if you are not, I think you must be familiar with things like estimation of the storeys. So how do we do the estimates? So the most common thing that we currently laid to is Storey pointing right?So this is just a just in which I am trying to explain to Otis Storey pointing. So there are a couple of methods that we tried to estimate there's old school, May 3rd storey point, May 3rd storey count and hybrid matters. The most common method is the storey appointments or which we normally deal in storey pointing. Also, there are two ways of Storey pointing that this T shirt sizing and the Fibonacci series oneso again a T shirt sizing, which is like small, medium large Axl, this is not that much used and the Fib Unity series, which is the most commonly used currently on storey pointing.So how is this done? For example? It's a very simple storey and we do not have anything to explore or lots of understanding. Then it will be a storey 0.1 or two, so here. The series is given of it wrong. And sorry I didn't cheque that out. It will be one told 357 notches. Cities. Okay, so if it is a simple one will give a one or two pointers.that a storey pointing is done along with the whole team. As you know, there are grooming sessions during which the whole team sits together, understands the storey and then, as per everybody is voting that is decided whether that storeys and easy one then will give an auto. If it is a medium complex storey will give it a three if it is more complex than it is a five and if it is extremely complicated and very, very difficult will give it eight.So most of the times we tried to break down eight point of storeys into lesser points. Like, you know, two models of three and five. Okay, one storey of three points, another of five points. So body A.

So how we are putting a tear in the simple largest explained to him So these are the name of the resources that are part of those Graham.So although people are names are written one other work days for which, for example, this is showing that it is a to experience that why that's why it is 10 days. Okay, In the two weeks we have 10 days, then we have categorised each type of work. Okay, so here you can see the availablenumber of days. Okay, So for example, this person don't have any vacation or anything else. So that's why he is completely available for all the 10 days and his complete work hours is 7010 into seven sewing plans. Seven hours. I am sorrysomething is here in miss Okay, He So we are considering here seven work hours per day. That's the reason we're have given a den into 7. 3070 of us.

It's nine into seven. That is an an hours per day of her, which comes to 63. So in this way, all the team's effort or work hours is calculated, and the total comes to around 3 15 hours.So this is a basic capacity plan, so I'll just give you a glimpse of the actual ones, which we normally use, so it's a bit more complicated than what you have seen, so", 'start_time': '00:06:40', 'end_time': '00:08:49'}, {'Topic': 'Capacity Planning Benefits', 'transcript': "not able to.

So total spring daisy A mentioning water, the holidays. If there is any any leads for any of the resources, what on the actual days. So what are the actual days means what at the days that they are actually working per day hours. So here we have taken six tapesix hours per day and we keep two hours for buffer. Usually that is assigned because, you know, we do have several meetings when we are part of the sprint or a scam. We have several meetings. So that's why be assigned belief to ask per day for this kind of activities, meeting activities and other, you know.Connexion, connecting with the your team members and also effective work hours.

Okay, so 20 for is the Dever covers and 140 for Solly. It's percent estimate. Whatever 135 you ever coveredalong with, we have another. okay? becoming Dombeck 50 person, 100%. Okay, so yeah, along that we have a few more things, like, you know, what is the available capacity? What is the time estimate and capacity utilisation. Capacity remaining. So, for example, a person has 36 capacity. But as per the storey points, we are able to assign only 30 work hours, so he will have a remaining capacity of 5% or fivein which he can accommodate any ad host stance or anything that comes in between. So those kind of things are also there. So here we can monitor which team member has got the, you know, his capacities move than his actual available capacity or it is lesser. And if if he has any banned with left, where we can take on", 'start_time': '00:08:57', 'end_time': '00:13:50'}, {'Topic': 'Challenges in Capacity Planning', 'transcript': "one Moting here is like here is the like, for example, here having all the team members and then So we are calculating here. The total devours the total Q hours. So he are out of these members. The people that are mentioned in yellow are testing team people, so the addition of all these peoplewe will be able to calculate the the way of us. And similarly, the addition of all these people that are in grade are the other deaf people. So the damper cars were able to calculate separately, and then we have the total bar covers. But yeah, this thing, whatever is the total, is it? It's coming here and we're getting the total were covers for Q and the for deaf and also for the team, So this is the way so.some of them things like. so long. Also, you know, though, didn't use this one much, but sometimes also from this. whatever data we are giving, we can also culprit velocity here. Or we can project the velocity that we will be able to achieve, okay?sahib. department in this manually, or is it through the era? So I am telling youth of this Excel sheet is actually mental manually. But we do have a G option of it doesn't happen like this. I will show you the gene option as after we have discussed. So I told him in to his red wine, raise the Excel sheet, which is a manual thing, which we do right. This is the one and also may have a Gina option which have issued.Sorry, Mon Amis. However question So withdrawing the screen on the right hand side where you have listed down the storey numbers and the name of the other way of doing the capacity Planning, however, know like this is the same capacity. So here now we are register jotting down the storeys that will be covering in the spread ride for every sprint before starting the spring. We aredoing a capacity planning, right? So the upcoming streamed We are listing down all the storeys that we will do in this train. And who will work on this print. Right? So for example, if this storey is being done by the developer Dipak So the package will have here his workouts. How many work of us even allocated? For example, out of his total capacity of 36 he will just give three hours for this. And then again there will besome Barca was for the tested as well they will give. Maybe they will give two hours. Okay, so that is the reason the invention ing it. Storey buys how much a storey points or how much Barca will not store ippon. Sorry hours breakdown actually right at the breakdown and the the task, right? Completely a ride. So every storeys we are breaking down. We're taking the hours considering the hours that will beof more like the developer. How much hours they spend? The tester, How much I was Davis pen And how much is the total hours? So accordingly you know, open the Pakis parking on this storey as well as this storey as well as this Storey said the complete fire cover should come to near about 36 so we can keep a track. Okay Addition of all these storeys will come to around 36 right? So you can get the totally here.So next comes is the advantages of capacity planning. So I want to just zoom out. You can get a you. so so for the advantages. So first of all, it is avoid burnout. So what is about team won out is like, you know, the Arges piling work on somebody. And we exactly do not have any idea that whether that person will be able to do or not, or whether he is stretching more just to, you know, fulfil the work and to awe do not want want to stumped him to function like that. We want the work to be done. But also it's not like a person is, you know, working late nights and weekends just to compete. We do not one that can be a planning properly,and we are able to estimate that. Okay, we have a delivery in the state. And so if they are planning in this way, our definitely will meet our posts will meet her deliberated. So this will help to do the work effectively without any stress on the team bus. It is the main thing, like so taking steps to get for understanding of your teams at Children positive in she won't overwhelm them with too many tasks and responsibilities and also support them in managing their time by prioritising the most impactful.then sent more realistic deadlines again the same thing. So it's like something which they can achieve. It's not like a career piling them on, and then at the end of the strength of, even if they are trying their level best, they are not able to achieve so Yah, we do not want that. So get details about availability straight from your team. You will get a much needed reality. Cheques on the Dugan manage deadline expectations according to what your team can actually produce,then the third point is identify skin sock shortages. So by evaluating your team's capacity and planning work in advance, it's easier to spot if projects require skills that your team doesn't have. Accounting for that early allows you to take proactive action, such as training someone on your team. Outsourcing attacks are changing the scope of the project, so I think this is very self explanatory. So when we are planning ahead, so we in.So what is the You know what is lacking and what will blockers in achieving our booths? All this identification will not come once we have jumped into the sprint, so it will come before you have actually taken the work, so you can project it and you can, you know, avoid that. And whatever you are committing, you will be able to deliver. That's the most important thing, right?so the challenges of capacity planning said stuff to understand band with. So, yeah, it is tough to understand band with because, you know, view we are projecting that. Okay, this person can do this much hours. It may be that Okay, that person, even if for he is mentioning that I will need three hours of world,Sometimes something happens and he is getting stuck and he needs another more two hours. It's actually not three hours. It's actually five hours. So in that way, when we are calculating everything we are considering, Okay, this work will only take three hours, but actually it is taking more. So this type of difficulty comes.And so that's why it is written. It's tough to understand band with, and though we have a solution to this, which is like the always came buffer hours, as I told you so, that that will take care of this and the gritty or whatever. So your team's bandits is always evolving as projects change and team members leave or join the ranks. So this is another challenge, right? Because, you know, team members are leaving and joining in the middle of this print and also that definitely impacts it.So plus, you need to rely on people's honesty about the current again. The same thing as I told a work may take more a work may take less. So that is also restriction all of that making a challenging to get a firm grasp on just how much capacity your team has available to tackle new work and request, particularly if you have a team full of high achievers always believed that they can takemore. Okay, the more often you have, you talked your team about their most three teams to it weekly, the easier it will get for you to be realist. So as an venue work with a certain team. You know, maybe in the first print your capacity may not be a perfect, but as and when you work on a multiple sprints, you know, like erafter first a Ken than third and consecutive sprint. Then you get the more better grasp on how much each person's capacities is. And if you were, you know, if you are committing more than that, also can district or if you are committing less than also that also you can increase it, so we will get a more realistic idea. Changes will throw you off track. They're gonna risk associated with them.The project and enforcement circumstances, from sense in seasonality to industry changes, will throw wrenches senior plans when you need to try to account for all these potentials. At best, capacity planning isn't always so straight forward. Planning in a cushion, even if it's just an extra day or two, will help you roll with the punches without things running of Paris. So again, this is something it it is likeeven if you are planning, there may be some hindrances, but you know it's much better to go with capacity than without capacity. Then it is like completely chaos, andthere is no planning and all if you're doing any, you know, starting or sprint without the capacity, so you will have to engage in some hard conversations again. This is a part of capacity and a tapestry. Planning is only useful if you though something with the information you identify that can involve turning down projects due to lack of bandwidth, adjusting a reducing expectations, pushing out deadlines. It's always better to say no than too serious and not to deliver. So this is the most inPorton part, you know. So capacity planning is for this reason only that you know what you are committing. You should be able to deliver. And if you you are saying like you are able to predict that, Okay, if this much of a commitment I'm giving, I will not be able to deliver than it's better to mention that beforehand rather than taking that one and then not delivering.

But as and when the A growth, the capacity planning for the future strengths on the next prince will definitely be better and will have a better idea about the amount of work which we should take and will be able to complete.

If we are using a Roadmaster of Witch spring, we will be able to complete feature one will sprint will be able to complete feature too. So this was kind of a projection. So how does it look into looks like this? Okay, so here you can see, I justSo here you can see a all the storeys that the left side are the epics. It is showing the epics. And these are the things the storeys that you will be able to complete stating the months you residency, the months in which month border the things that we can complete, right?so maybe this epic will be able to complete in the month of December.

Capacity planning is defined as determining the necessary hours for projects while assessing team bandwidth. It involves accurately identifying work hours for scrum team members within a sprint, considering factors like task complexity and individual availability. Techniques for capacity estimation, including story pointing methods like T-shirt sizing and the Fibonacci series, are discussed to collaboratively estimate user story complexity. The use of capacity planning tools is highlighted, with a focus on tracking work hours, member availability, and total team capacity, emphasizing the need for efficient resource allocation.\n\nChallenges in capacity planning, such as understanding team bandwidth and the evolving nature of team composition, are addressed. Best practices include ongoing communication and adapting to changes. The session also discusses roadmapping as an essential tool for planning large projects, breaking down epics into smaller tasks, and managing timelines and dependencies. The importance of roadmap management in project execution is emphasized, alongside features in JIRA for creating and managing roadmaps, including setting start and due dates, tracking progress, and visualizing dependencies.\n\nFinally, the session concludes with a recap and an invitation for questions, underlining the importance of feedback and continuous improvement in capacity planning and roadmap management.'}

So, according to the definition that is given here, is capacity planning is the process of identifying how many hours a project or task will require too demanding whether or not your team has the available bans it to complete it and then coordinating that work for maximum efficiency. So what it exactly means is instead offer. You know, I'm just guessing that how much offer can be done.Capacity planning is a complete process in which we are actually identifying the number of work hours that a person on already member in the scrum team can put in and the maximum work that can be achieved with within the spring time frame. For example, if it is a two week spent, then what is the maximum number of effective work hours that each of the resource can give? So that determines the capacityand er It also includes things like, you know, complexity of the storey, and also it's like if it is a very complex storey, then definitely the storey point is more and so that's the reason the efficiency or the, you know work hours will be more and if it is a a medium or lesser complex than definitely the number of our covers required will be lives. So everything of this we take into consideration along witha, for example, a team member out of 15 days. Or to explain that the stand a strength, he will be only for the next two days or last two days. Whatever. Okay, so his effective days will be around eight days, right? So they'll also consider that that okay, he is actually available for eight days, and according to its, his work hours will be calculated.So what is the benefit of this? So the benefit of this is that you know, we are not keeping anything for, you know, like Cobb, depending on the chance of completion. It's like a sure shot. What they are projecting, what they are planning, what we are focusing, we are able to achieve it. So that is the main benefit of compactD planning. When we do capacity planning in a proper weight and there is very less chance that the gold will be missed or, you know, the maximum among the work we are able to achieve, rather than if we are not doing any capacity planning and randomly taking into work the new know Most of the time it's like we miss on the target and there are storeys which will spill over and you know there will be a chaos with industry.So this is the basic things are going forward with some more points on capacity planning. It's like on tapestry. Planning helps the team understand the amount of productive engineering time available in a sprint. For example, To perform capacity planning for energy team, you must gather each teammembers availability and time of, as I said regarding their holidays or leaves, you know, I said about the leaves. If there is holidays during those springtime, then definitely we also considered that. And that time of will be for everybody. That is part of the strength.So So this is telling that and then add up the individual capacity to calculate the team's overall capacity. So the complete work covers for each of the team members in adding of all each team members complete work hours. We can make the full capacity of the T right that aghast on your team's overall capacity, which is maximum amount of work that you can pile on their plate before you have over extended them, which we don't want.", 'keywords': ['Capacity Planning', 'Team Availability', 'Work Efficiency'], 'summary': 'The transcript provides an in-depth explanation of capacity planning, defining it as the process of determining the necessary work hours for projects or tasks to assess whether a team can meet its demands. It emphasizes the importance of coordinating tasks for maximum efficiency and avoiding guesswork. The speaker elaborates on how capacity planning involves evaluating the available hours of team members, considering factors like the complexity of tasks and individual availability. By calculating the effective work hours within a set timeframe, such as a two-week sprint, teams can better understand their capacity. This careful planning minimizes the risk of missing targets and helps achieve project goals by ensuring that work is allocated realistically based on team capabilities.

That's very will prioritise task and scheduled those hours so that work is completed by the intended deadline. So capacity means you will root the project plan expectations in reality. So we are not keeping anything for, you know, guess work rather than you're optimistic guesses about what team can churn. Oh, this is the basic thing about capacity. The next comes the ways to estimate so.if a some of you guys are working currently on sprint based projects or even if you are not, I think you must be familiar with things like estimation of the storeys. So how do we do the estimates? So the most common thing that we currently laid to is Storey pointing right?So this is just a just in which I am trying to explain to Otis Storey pointing. So there are a couple of methods that we tried to estimate there's old school, May 3rd storey point, May 3rd storey count and hybrid matters. The most common method is the storey appointments or which we normally deal in storey pointing. Also, there are two ways of Storey pointing that this T shirt sizing and the Fibonacci series oneso again a T shirt sizing, which is like small, medium large Axl, this is not that much used and the Fib Unity series, which is the most commonly used currently on storey pointing.So how is this done? For example? It's a very simple storey and we do not have anything to explore or lots of understanding. Then it will be a storey 0.1 or two, so here. The series is given of it wrong. And sorry I didn't cheque that out. It will be one told 357 notches. Cities. Okay, so if it is a simple one will give a one or two pointers.that a storey pointing is done along with the whole team. As you know, there are grooming sessions during which the whole team sits together, understands the storey and then, as per everybody is voting that is decided whether that storeys and easy one then will give an auto. If it is a medium complex storey will give it a three if it is more complex than it is a five and if it is extremely complicated and very, very difficult will give it eight.So most of the times we tried to break down eight point of storeys into lesser points. Like, you know, two models of three and five. Okay, one storey of three points, another of five points. So body A. This is the way of just, you know, deciding which storey is of how much difficulty levelSo this is just a rough or in a very simple what can is it? A table which is showing how we are doing the capacity planning, though in other real instance are in show you how it issues showing. So the normally we have two ways of doing this capacity planning.", 'keywords': ['Capacity Planning', 'Story Pointing', 'Estimation Methods'], 'summary': 'The transcript discusses the planning stage of capacity planning, highlighting its importance in prioritizing tasks and scheduling work to meet deadlines effectively.

Okay, In the two weeks we have 10 days, then we have categorised each type of work. Okay, so here you can see the availablenumber of days.

So I am telling youth of this Excel sheet is actually mental manually. But we do have a G option of it doesn't happen like this. I will show you the gene option as after we have discussed. So I told him in to his red wine, raise the Excel sheet, which is a manual thing, which we do right. This is the one and also may have a Gina option which have issued.Sorry, Mon Amis. However question So withdrawing the screen on the right hand side where you have listed down the storey numbers and the name of the other way of doing the capacity Planning, however,know like this is the same capacity. So here now we are register jotting down the storeys that will be covering in the spread ride for every sprint before starting the spring. We aredoing a capacity planning, right? So the upcoming streamed We are listing down all the storeys that we will do in this train. And who will work on this print. Right? So for example, if this storey is being done by the developer Dipak So the package will have here his workouts. How many work of us even allocated? For example, out of his total capacity of 36 he will just give three hours for this. And then again there will besome Barca was for the tested as well they will give. Maybe they will give two hours. Okay, so that is the reason the invention ing it. Storey buys how much a storey points or how much Barca will not store ippon. Sorry hours breakdown actually right at the breakdown and the the task, right? Completely a ride. So every storeys we are breaking down. We're taking the hours considering the hours that will beof more like the developer. How much hours they spend? The tester, How much I was Davis pen And how much is the total hours? So accordingly you know, open the Pakis parking on this storey as well as this storey as well as this Storey said the complete fire cover should come to near about 36 so we can keep a track. Okay Addition of all these storeys will come to around 36 right? So you can get the totally here.So next comes is the advantages of capacity planning. So I want to just zoom out. You can get a you. so so for the advantages. So first of all, it is avoid burnout. So what is about team won out is like, you know, the Arges piling work on somebody. And we exactly do not have any idea that whether that person will be able to do or not, or whether he is stretching more just to, you know, fulfil the work and to awe do not want want to stumped him to function like that. We want the work to be done. But also it's not like a person is, you know, working late nights and weekends just to compete. We do not one that can be a planning properly,and we are able to estimate that. Okay, we have a delivery in the state. And so if they are planning in this way, our definitely will meet our posts will meet her deliberated. So this will help to do the work effectively without any stress on the team bus. It is the main thing, like so taking steps to get for understanding of your teams at Children positive in she won't overwhelm them with too many tasks and responsibilities and also support them in managing their time by prioritising the most impactful.then sent more realistic deadlines again the same thing. So it's like something which they can achieve. It's not like a career piling them on, and then at the end of the strength of, even if they are trying their level best, they are not able to achieve so Yah, we do not want that. So get details about availability straight from your team. You will get a much needed reality. Cheques on the Dugan manage deadline expectations according to what your team can actually produce,then the third point is identify skin sock shortages. So by evaluating your team's capacity and planning work in advance, it's easier to spot if projects require skills that your team doesn't have. Accounting for that early allows you to take proactive action, such as training someone on your team. Outsourcing attacks are changing the scope of the project, so I think this is very self explanatory. So when we are planning ahead, so we in.So what is the You know what is lacking and what will blockers in achieving our booths? All this identification will not come once we have jumped into the sprint, so it will come before you have actually taken the work, so you can project it and you can, you know, avoid that. And whatever you are committing, you will be able to deliver. That's the most important thing, right?so the challenges of capacity planning said stuff to understand band with. So, yeah, it is tough to understand band with because, you know, view we are projecting that. Okay, this person can do this much hours. It may be that Okay, that person, even if for he is mentioning that I will need three hours of world,Sometimes something happens and he is getting stuck and he needs another more two hours. It's actually not three hours. It's actually five hours. So in that way, when we are calculating everything we are considering, Okay, this work will only take three hours, but actually it is taking more. So this type of difficulty comes.And so that's why it is written. It's tough to understand band with, and though we have a solution to this, which is like the always came buffer hours, as I told you so, that that will take care of this and the gritty or whatever. So your team's bandits is always evolving as projects change and team members leave or join the ranks. So this is another challenge, right? Because, you know, team members are leaving and joining in the middle of this print and also that definitely impacts it.So plus, you need to rely on people's honesty about the current again. The same thing as I told a work may take more a work may take less. So that is also restriction all of that making a challenging to get a firm grasp on just how much capacity your team has available to tackle new work and request, particularly if you have a team full of high achievers always believed that they can takemore. Okay, the more often you have, you talked your team about their most three teams to it weekly, the easier it will get for you to be realist. So as an venue work with a certain team. You know, maybe in the first print your capacity may not be a perfect, but as and when you work on a multiple sprints, you know, like erafter first a Ken than third and consecutive sprint. Then you get the more better grasp on how much each person's capacities is. And if you were, you know, if you are committing more than that, also can district or if you are committing less than also that also you can increase it, so we will get a more realistic idea. Changes will throw you off track. They're gonna risk associated with them.The project and enforcement circumstances, from sense in seasonality to industry changes, will throw wrenches senior plans when you need to try to account for all these potentials. At best, capacity planning isn't always so straight forward. Planning in a cushion, even if it's just an extra day or two, will help you roll with the punches without things running of Paris. So again, this is something it it is likeeven if you are planning, there may be some hindrances, but you know it's much better to go with capacity than without capacity. Then it is like completely chaos, andthere is no planning and all if you're doing any, you know, starting or sprint without the capacity, so you will have to engage in some hard conversations again. This is a part of capacity and a tapestry. Planning is only useful if you though something with the information you identify that can involve turning down projects due to lack of bandwidth, adjusting a reducing expectations, pushing out deadlines. It's always better to say no than too serious and not to deliver. So this is the most inPorton part, you know. So capacity planning is for this reason only that you know what you are committing. You should be able to deliver. And if you you are saying like you are able to predict that, Okay, if this much of a commitment I'm giving, I will not be able to deliver than it's better to mention that beforehand rather than taking that one and then not delivering.

So, according to the definition that is given here, is capacity planning is the process of identifying how many hours a project or task will require too demanding whether or not your team has the available bans it to complete it and then coordinating that work for maximum efficiency. So what it exactly means is instead offer. You know, I'm just guessing that how much offer can be done.Capacity planning is a complete process in which we are actually identifying the number of work hours that a person on already member in the scrum team can put in and the maximum work that can be achieved with within the spring time frame. For example, if it is a two week spent, then what is the maximum number of effective work hours that each of the resource can give? So that determines the capacityand er It also includes things like, you know, complexity of the storey, and also it's like if it is a very complex storey, then definitely the storey point is more and so that's the reason the efficiency or the, you know work hours will be more and if it is a a medium or lesser complex than definitely the number of our covers required will be lives. So everything of this we take into consideration along witha, for example, a team member out of 15 days. Or to explain that the stand a strength, he will be only for the next two days or last two days. Whatever. Okay, so his effective days will be around eight days, right? So they'll also consider that that okay, he is actually available for eight days, and according to its, his work hours will be calculated.So what is the benefit of this? So the benefit of this is that you know, we are not keeping anything for, you know, like Cobb, depending on the chance of completion. It's like a sure shot. What they are projecting, what they are planning, what we are focusing, we are able to achieve it. So that is the main benefit of compactD planning. When we do capacity planning in a proper weight and there is very less chance that the gold will be missed or, you know, the maximum among the work we are able to achieve, rather than if we are not doing any capacity planning and randomly taking into work the new know Most of the time it's like we miss on the target and there are storeys which will spill over and you know there will be a chaos with industry.So this is the basic things are going forward with some more points on capacity planning. It's like on tapestry. Planning helps the team understand the amount of productive engineering time available in a sprint. For example, To perform capacity planning for energy team, you must gather each teammembers availability and time of, as I said regarding their holidays or leaves, you know, I said about the leaves. If there is holidays during those springtime, then definitely we also considered that. And that time of will be for everybody. That is part of the strength.So So this is telling that and then add up the individual capacity to calculate the team's overall capacity. So the complete work covers for each of the team members in adding of all each team members complete work hours. We can make the full capacity of the T right that aghast on your team's overall capacity, which is maximum amount of work that you can pile on their plate before you have over extended them, which we don't want.", 'start_time': '00:00:22', 'end_time': '00:03:58'}, {'Topic': 'Capacity Planning Benefits', 'transcript': "So once you have that information, you move into the planning stage. That's very will prioritise task and scheduled those hours so that work is completed by the intended deadline. So capacity means you will root the project plan expectations in reality. So we are not keeping anything for, you know, guess work rather than you're optimistic guesses about what team can churn. Oh, this is the basic thing about capacity. The next comes the ways to estimate so.if a some of you guys are working currently on sprint based projects or even if you are not, I think you must be familiar with things like estimation of the storeys. So how do we do the estimates? So the most common thing that we currently laid to is Storey pointing right?So this is just a just in which I am trying to explain to Otis Storey pointing. So there are a couple of methods that we tried to estimate there's old school, May 3rd storey point, May 3rd storey count and hybrid matters. The most common method is the storey appointments or which we normally deal in storey pointing. Also, there are two ways of Storey pointing that this T shirt sizing and the Fibonacci series oneso again a T shirt sizing, which is like small, medium large Axl, this is not that much used and the Fib Unity series, which is the most commonly used currently on storey pointing.So how is this done? For example? It's a very simple storey and we do not have anything to explore or lots of understanding. Then it will be a storey 0.1 or two, so here. The series is given of it wrong. And sorry I didn't cheque that out. It will be one told 357 notches. Cities. Okay, so if it is a simple one will give a one or two pointers.that a storey pointing is done along with the whole team. As you know, there are grooming sessions during which the whole team sits together, understands the storey and then, as per everybody is voting that is decided whether that storeys and easy one then will give an auto. If it is a medium complex storey will give it a three if it is more complex than it is a five and if it is extremely complicated and very, very difficult will give it eight.So most of the times we tried to break down eight point of storeys into lesser points. Like, you know, two models of three and five. Okay, one storey of three points, another of five points. So body A. This is the way of just, you know, deciding which storey is of how much difficulty levelSo this is just a rough or in a very simple what can is it? A table which is showing how we are doing the capacity planning, though in other real instance are in show you how it issues showing.

Okay, In the two weeks we have 10 days, then we have categorised each type of work. Okay, so here you can see the availablenumber of days. Okay, So for example, this person don't have any vacation or anything else. So that's why he is completely available for all the 10 days and his complete work hours is 7010 into seven sewing plans. Seven hours. I am sorrysomething is here in miss Okay, He So we are considering here seven work hours per day. That's the reason we're have given a den into 7. 3070 of us.

It's nine into seven. That is an an hours per day of her, which comes to 63. So in this way, all the team's effort or work hours is calculated, and the total comes to around 3 15 hours.So this is a basic capacity plan, so I'll just give you a glimpse of the actual ones, which we normally use, so it's a bit more complicated than what you have seen, so", 'start_time': '00:07:00', 'end_time': '00:08:49'}, {'Topic': 'Technical Issues', 'transcript': "not able to.

So total spring daisy A mentioning water, the holidays. If there is any any leads for any of the resources, what on the actual days. So what are the actual days means what at the days that they are actually working per day hours. So here we have taken six tapesix hours per day and we keep two hours for buffer. Usually that is assigned because, you know, we do have several meetings when we are part of the sprint or a scam. We have several meetings. So that's why be assigned belief to ask per day for this kind of activities, meeting activities and other, you know.Connexion, connecting with the your team members and also effective work hours.

But as per the storey points, we are able to assign only 30 work hours, so he will have a remaining capacity of 5% or fivein which he can accommodate any ad host stance or anything that comes in between.

So I am telling youth of this Excel sheet is actually mental manually. But we do have a G option of it doesn't happen like this. I will show you the gene option as after we have discussed. So I told him in to his red wine, raise the Excel sheet, which is a manual thing, which we do right. This is the one and also may have a Gina option which have issued.Sorry, Mon Amis. However question So withdrawing the screen on the right hand side where you have listed down the storey numbers and the name of the other way of doing the capacity Planning, however,know like this is the same capacity. So here now we are register jotting down the storeys that will be covering in the spread ride for every sprint before starting the spring. We aredoing a capacity planning, right? So the upcoming streamed We are listing down all the storeys that we will do in this train. And who will work on this print. Right? So for example, if this storey is being done by the developer Dipak So the package will have here his workouts. How many work of us even allocated? For example, out of his total capacity of 36 he will just give three hours for this. And then again there will besome Barca was for the tested as well they will give. Maybe they will give two hours. Okay, so that is the reason the invention ing it. Storey buys how much a storey points or how much Barca will not store ippon. Sorry hours breakdown actually right at the breakdown and the the task, right? Completely a ride. So every storeys we are breaking down. We're taking the hours considering the hours that will beof more like the developer. How much hours they spend? The tester, How much I was Davis pen And how much is the total hours? So accordingly you know, open the Pakis parking on this storey as well as this storey as well as this Storey said the complete fire cover should come to near about 36 so we can keep a track. Okay Addition of all these storeys will come to around 36 right? So you can get the totally here.So next comes is the advantages of capacity planning. So I want to just zoom out. You can get a you. so so for the advantages. So first of all, it is avoid burnout. So what is about team won out is like, you know, the Arges piling work on somebody. And we exactly do not have any idea that whether that person will be able to do or not, or whether he is stretching more just to, you know, fulfil the work and to awe do not want want to stumped him to function like that. We want the work to be done. But also it's not like a person is, you know, working late nights and weekends just to compete. We do not one that can be a planning properly,and we are able to estimate that. Okay, we have a delivery in the state. And so if they are planning in this way, our definitely will meet our posts will meet her deliberated. So this will help to do the work effectively without any stress on the team bus. It is the main thing, like so taking steps to get for understanding of your teams at Children positive in she won't overwhelm them with too many tasks and responsibilities and also support them in managing their time by prioritising the most impactful.then sent more realistic deadlines again the same thing. So it's like something which they can achieve. It's not like a career piling them on, and then at the end of the strength of, even if they are trying their level best, they are not able to achieve so Yah, we do not want that. So get details about availability straight from your team. You will get a much needed reality. Cheques on the Dugan manage deadline expectations according to what your team can actually produce,then the third point is identify skin sock shortages. So by evaluating your team's capacity and planning work in advance, it's easier to spot if projects require skills that your team doesn't have. Accounting for that early allows you to take proactive action, such as training someone on your team. Outsourcing attacks are changing the scope of the project, so I think this is very self explanatory. So when we are planning ahead, so we in.So what is the You know what is lacking and what will blockers in achieving our booths? All this identification will not come once we have jumped into the sprint, so it will come before you have actually taken the work, so you can project it and you can, you know, avoid that. And whatever you are committing, you will be able to deliver. That's the most important thing, right?so the challenges of capacity planning said stuff to understand band with. So, yeah, it is tough to understand band with because, you know, view we are projecting that. Okay, this person can do this much hours. It may be that Okay, that person, even if for he is mentioning that I will need three hours of world,Sometimes something happens and he is getting stuck and he needs another more two hours. It's actually not three hours. It's actually five hours. So in that way, when we are calculating everything we are considering, Okay, this work will only take three hours, but actually it is taking more. So this type of difficulty comes.And so that's why it is written. It's tough to understand band with, and though we have a solution to this, which is like the always came buffer hours, as I told you so, that that will take care of this and the gritty or whatever. So your team's bandits is always evolving as projects change and team members leave or join the ranks. So this is another challenge, right? Because, you know, team members are leaving and joining in the middle of this print and also that definitely impacts it.So plus, you need to rely on people's honesty about the current again. The same thing as I told a work may take more a work may take less. So that is also restriction all of that making a challenging to get a firm grasp on just how much capacity your team has available to tackle new work and request, particularly if you have a team full of high achievers always believed that they can takemore. Okay, the more often you have, you talked your team about their most three teams to it weekly, the easier it will get for you to be realist. So as an venue work with a certain team. You know, maybe in the first print your capacity may not be a perfect, but as and when you work on a multiple sprints, you know, like erafter first a Ken than third and consecutive sprint. Then you get the more better grasp on how much each person's capacities is. And if you were, you know, if you are committing more than that, also can district or if you are committing less than also that also you can increase it, so we will get a more realistic idea. Changes will throw you off track. They're gonna risk associated with them.The project and enforcement circumstances, from sense in seasonality to industry changes, will throw wrenches senior plans when you need to try to account for all these potentials. At best, capacity planning isn't always so straight forward. Planning in a cushion, even if it's just an extra day or two, will help you roll with the punches without things running of Paris. So again, this is something it it is likeeven if you are planning, there may be some hindrances, but you know it's much better to go with capacity than without capacity. Then it is like completely chaos, andthere is no planning and all if you're doing any, you know, starting or sprint without the capacity, so you will have to engage in some hard conversations again. This is a part of capacity and a tapestry. Planning is only useful if you though something with the information you identify that can involve turning down projects due to lack of bandwidth, adjusting a reducing expectations, pushing out deadlines. It's always better to say no than too serious and not to deliver. So this is the most inPorton part, you know. So capacity planning is for this reason only that you know what you are committing. You should be able to deliver. And if you you are saying like you are able to predict that, Okay, if this much of a commitment I'm giving, I will not be able to deliver than it's better to mention that beforehand rather than taking that one and then not delivering.

Our team level roadmaps useful for planning large basis of work several months in advance. A terrific level within a single project. Simple planning and dependency management features help your team's visualise and manage work better. So what is exactly a roadmap is nothing but a planning feature in bet. You know, you canput in all the epics and under native storeys, and you can see the complete picture of like, for example, in which sprint you will be able to complete what feature Sova. Normally, you know the identify features okay, will do this by this April end will do this feature by maybe June will do this feature so fnothing will be clearly visible. If we are using a Roadmaster of Witch spring, we will be able to complete feature one will sprint will be able to complete feature too. So this was kind of a projection. So how does it look into looks like this? Okay, so here you can see, I just", 'start_time': '00:32:45', 'end_time': '00:33:59'}, {'Topic': 'Roadmap Creation', 'transcript': "So here you can see a all the storeys that the left side are the epics. It is showing the epics. And these are the things the storeys that you will be able to complete stating the months you residency, the months in which month border the things that we can complete, right?so maybe this epic will be able to complete in the month of December. The second epic will be able to again complete in December the cross team effort epic they will be completing by November. So this other projections that have been made right and the the strike type of things will also be explaining this is kind of dependence is that's right slinking here.so far, the key concepts of ethics. Okay, so for I'm in for creating a road map, things that you need to know at the Buddhism and epic is a large body of us that can be broken down into individual tasks required to ship of feature. The world probe becomes a child issue of the epic. Sometimes owner spending epics are displayed as collard bus onthe road map. As I showed you, it was so of epics Are you know again? As I said, like a feature, you there is a feature. Okay, So if that feature is a small feature, if it is a big feature than again, features will be broken down. But if it is a small features that you can't convert into an epic,so just you will create an epic, and underneath it you will again create storeys of that in order to achieve that feature, what other things you need to what other steps you need to do border the storeys that need to be turning out to create that feature in order to complete that feature. So that is epics. So as again, as I said to you, So these are the epics, this whatever icon you are saying in the left, those are epic aiglons.and these are, though, things depicted in coloured bars. what is a child issue again? As I said, under need the epic the create storeys. So the storeys are nothing but child issues. Child issues can be created directly from the road map and administered within the epic the belonged So the storeys that will create under the epic an honest child issues the most common childish you a storeys, tasks and bugs. Okay, but you can create new issue types to represent different type of work for your team's quickly move issues to other tipping and reorder issues or epics by dragging and dropping themdirectly from your road map. So this is kind of saying how you are able to do that. Okay, so you can see the screenshot here. So this is a bug. So under name this epic, which is group booking experience. So they are trying to create a bag or a storey or a tusk. Okay,next to start and dude is the length of the bar on the road map for alleged at the start and due date set for Europe. Pick setting dates for your epic helps to communicate plans with the team and provide visual visibility to external stakeholders. Informed dependence in mapping and helped the resource management. So yeah, so start and doodles are very important. In order to project when you will be able to complete the feature or the epic,you're starting a due date of each of the storeys or child into issues matter, you know, so that you are able to understand. OK, completely a get this epic we will be able to complete in the stand this epic. This temps of this feature will be done by this time Fring.So this is depicting being depicted here. As you can see, the the the the thing that the Yeah. So So far epic when you are putting her start date and the due date So that is kind of you know, high level but in a storey is you know, when you are taking up storeys we normally understand that this storey will be completing in this print trade even if it's a storey you were expectingto take two days. Okay, But out of everything it mill maximum taker, Another buffer two days you will complete by four days. Right? So definitely by the end of the sprint you will complete that storey, right? So when you were giving the start date and ended to the storeys, that is a definite dates night. Almost definite it there is a major.Bata How If you are talking about projection of the epic skirt things then you can say a air kind of predicting When's once all the bodies the end it here is when all the storeys within the epic will end Right That date we will give us the end.

You cannot start storey pright. So this can be, you know, Mom, this can be shown in the road map dependency Management is critical for teams. When dependence is our visualised and well mapped, a team can adapt and plan for alternative parts. Indira Software You can easily show the relationship between epics by mapping dependence is directly from the road.So this is the way. As I told you, these things show that dependencies. Okay, So for example, once this is done, you can be able to do this. Okay? Say it's mentioned, Bill. Cheque out Experience blocks this.

Capacity planning is defined as the process of determining necessary work hours for projects to assess team demands, emphasizing task coordination and realistic work allocation to minimize risks and achieve project goals. It involves evaluating team members' available hours, considering task complexity, and using estimation methods like story pointing with techniques such as the Fibonacci series and T-shirt sizing for task assessment. The speaker discusses using templates to track work hours, noting the importance of recording team availability and calculating effective work hours. Capacity utilization is addressed, focusing on assessing available capacity and workload assignment, with examples illustrating the calculation of remaining capacity for team members.\n\nThe discussion also covers challenges in capacity planning, including the need for accurate data and tools like Excel, as well as the importance of honest communication about team capacity. Best practices emphasize learning from past projects and maintaining transparency between Scrum Masters and developers. The concept of road mapping in software development is introduced, highlighting its role in planning extensive work, visualizing project timelines, and managing dependencies among tasks. The process of creating a roadmap involves managing epics and child issues, setting start and due dates, and visualizing progress. The speaker discusses the significance of dependency management and tracking progress against the roadmap, including the need for manual updates to reflect changes in project timelines. The session concludes with an overview of creating and exporting roadmaps using the software 'Najera' and an invitation for further questions and engagement."}

This man is flashing this boat in front of the cat's eyes and in turn, they are recording the impulse in the cat's brain.Okay, so this was the experiment done by them, uh, human and basil.

Okay, so let's say, uh, this isn't modified image image, so I have just shrink the zero and, uh, introduced some translation variance. So what I'm doing here is that I took a simple MLP.You can call it, uh, zero director for now. It only detects if, uh, zero is present in some part of image or not. Okay, so, uh, what I'm doing here is I'm taking small part of the image and then flattening it. Okay,so, uh, let's say it has, uh, 2020 some 400 pixels here. Okay, Le, let's assume that this is a small part of this entire image and then flattening it and then putting it into one MLP. Okay, then I'm scanning across all this, uh, this entire image and looking for occurrence of zero.So what is the output of this? MLP would be, uh, probability distribution between 0 to, uh 1 which says that if it has detected zero or not. So if it thinks that the image which was cast into this MLP contains a zero, it will have a very high probability, otherwise very low probability.Okay, so I'm just scanning this entire image, using my MLP who look for the zero. Okay. So once I have scanned the entire image. And if I see if at any place there was a high output from a model, then I would say, Okay, I have found a zero. So in this way.

Oh, is that a kind of an or gate or kind of order of the outputs from here? What is, uh,yes? So basically, uh, I'm saying the highest of the highest for all these. Let's say this is, uh, the probability of finding a 00.10 0.01 and sometimes they'd say, Okay, I have very high probability of occurrence of zero. So I take the maximum of all these and then say Okay,I have found So zero Harris means means that I have found that the zero. Okay, so that's confusing. That, uhthat's good. So it was probably in the mind of the students, so I just thought I'd cheque. So it's a maximum that you're taking That takes the maximum. Yes.So this is where we have? Yeah, Yeah, for me. It's like 740. It's okay, but for seven, if we scan some part of seven and we could get one, right?Yeah, that's a valid problem. Uh, for that, uh, what we can do is we could we could add additional features. So that, uh, one so we can search for specific features, often digit digit. So let's say,uh, we could Instead of searching for the entire digit, we could search for some parts of it. So let's say if I have a feature like this, then maybe it's, uh indicates the presence of zero. Okay. And if I say that, Okay, there are four features which looks like this. They are coming in an image, so I can say, Okay, these are very close to zero, so you can just break that down into small features instead of taking into account the entire dignity.So what we're doing is we're hierarchically building this storey. So even another question that you should be asking at this point is that, uh, has chosen a box size that stores all of zero in it. Right? So also, he's shifting the scan that's taking place. He's shifting that, uh, square box in this exampleby a certain amount. Right. So if you are shifting by a certain amount, you might get part of the digit.

So this is called wait sharing him here. So we are sharing the weights. We're not introducing new weights at every, uh, box here,so which helps in reducing the A total number of parameters. We will study this, uh, detailing for the slides.So the key idea is that any any layer in MLP there's only one thing which is taking the weighted sum of inputs and applying a non linearity.

So this output would go here in the next,uh, and output from this second box, which is shifted slightly. It would be just a decent road here.

So when we talk about philtres, another way of thinking of these philtres these philtres comes from image processing,right where humans used to handcraft these philtres to extract features like edges and so on.

It then has a max full, then to conclusion blocks of 128. uh, philtres each again for school and then three conclusions by, uh, containing 2. 56 philtres and so on. You can see here and then we have a fully connected layer. Uh, the final layer, which classifies each imagine 2000 categories.This is the basic architecture of this video. 16.

Okay, this is the fourth layer next, moving on to the seventh layer so you can see, uh, things are getting more abstract here. It's difficult to describe what features. Uh, CNN is learning,but we can see that something different is happening with each feature map. So there is a definition of house here, but in here, we have totally lost it. Maybe this this philtre would was looking for something else. which is not present in this feature in this image,maybe something like that. Okay, so now we have reached 11th layer. It has, I think, 2. 56 philtres and I'm displaying only 64 corresponding feature maps out of these two physics. Okay, No, things have become more abstract. And then, you know, 15th layer,uh, things become even more abstract. You could see that that some freedom maps are, uh, not saying anything at all. For example, there's there's only slight activation here, but for some philtres, there are a lot of evacuations happening.and in 17 player. So this has, uh, 512 feature maps and displaying only 64. You could see that only some some part of theafter the conclusion. Output has some information in it. Rest everything is just shut down. Okay, so let me just go through that again. So this is the first congressional put second. So ifeverybody realising that each of these small images is one layer now in that output right in this, so I shouldn't say one layer one feature, right? So one channel within the fourth layer. So everybody using, uh, you know, onepretty good right to generate each of these small images here, Right? And we're seeing What is it that it is learning from this image? And of course, this is the house. And, like, uh, was saying the V G architecture has been developed to learn 1000 different classes, right? So for different classes of images, you'll have different features, uh, getting highlighted right. And as we go throughright now, we are identifying edges and some relationships between those edges. But we're basically as we go, deeper and deeper,it actually becomes much more abstract, but is useful finally to make a classification that this is a house as opposed to an elephantright. Okay. Carry on group. Yeah. So this was the output of first conclusion block. 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th. And finally, we could use this output for classification. So basically, what we have done here is that we took an image and we extracted features out of that,and to some to that extent, that we are able to build a classified over it. That when we have an image of in house, we could say some features get activated if we have, uh, image of human that several different features get activated, and then we can use these activations to basically just classify or input dimension.Right. So here have how blood cells are. Okay, So the first output you could see here is that, uh, several feature maps are looking at the skin. Some are looking at beard. Some are looking at this the turbo and some are looking at the edges. So this is this little These feature maps would work for any human rights.On the second conclusion output, you could see things become more abstract. Then in third National Boardfort, you can see that this, uh, these features around here, they somehow represent I guess that human face that eyes and mouth Maybe that's my guess. I'm not sure.And again, in the just the final conclusion block things become very extracted. Only few future master activity dressed are just shut down.So here we have, uh, to human faces in the image so you could see in the final layer. So I'm showing, uh, all the 512 accusations here in the final conclusion block. So you could see, uh, things which are highlighted here in yellow.So similar features have been activated here. If you take a look at these two, these two here, and these two here, they look pretty similar.So we expect that any human, uh, face would excite these, uh, future maps of this, uh, Jeanette. And then later we can use this information, uh, to just classify that which category an image belongs to.Remember that the objective here is not to discriminate and identify between Luke and myself. Here. This is actually just to classify it into, uh, face versus house.Yes. So here we have a face versus house, so you can see that, uh, these are the features activated and different set of features activated in the final constitution outputso you can see they are not in this In this area, these we can have some not activity. any questions on this.Okay, Uh, we are at the end of the lecture, so I think Is this a good place to stop? Yes. Great. Excellent. Okay. So thank you so much for this. I think that's been wonderful.

Is CNN architectures and some way to regularise them or improve their performance.Okay, so, uh, I believe that you are very familiar with Mr Asset, so it basically consists, uh, black and white images, which are 28 by 2018 size. So And they have one digit from 0 to 9 representing in that image.So basically, a simple MLP for, uh would require you to flatten this image. So you flatten it out into a 287, 84 dimensional victor one by 74uh, Dimension vector. And you just fit a simple multi layer perceptron into it and classify each input into one of the 10 classes.So this is the typical, uh, workflow for amnesty, and we are easily able to achieve 95 maybe 98% accuracy on the state of using very simple Uh, okay,', 'start_time': '00:05:24', 'end_time': '00:06:49'}, {'Topic': 'Model Performance and Generalization', 'transcript': "So a typical output for for the last level look something like this. So this is a 10 dimensions input output. So this is the zero index, and this is the ninth index. So, uh, each the index. Basically, it tells you what is the budget on this image. So for this in 49 you can see the ninth, uh, value in this output. Uh, this is basically a probability distribution.So the ninth area has the ninth value. Sorry. The 10th value, The last value has the value of 0.99. So the model is very confident that this image contains the ninth.Similarly, for three, you can see the third index has, uh, like a perfect one probability for being three. And similarly, for two, you have this. So what I did was simply I just, uh,changed the input to the, uh, neural network, which was trained on this administrator. So I just shrink the images slightly and, uh, changed the position where the budgets were so earlier. It was just sent in central incentive, but now I am putting these digits on the sideways, and they are slightly smaller than earlier So what happened immediately was that the predictions were very messed up.So the model thinks that this budget is 012345. So the model think it's five, but it's actually zero. So you see that, uh, only with a slide shift of the image, the model's performance has reduced drastically. Similarly, for six, the model thinks it is 0123456.uh sure. Uh Yeah. So the model thinks 87. Okay, but, uh, So the key idea here is that the predictions got messed up similarly with one hair. So we would expect this to be the outfit of your model, but model was predicting this. So there is some error. So we need to make which is robust to these, uh, these kinds of variations,okay. So the key idea. So the key findings from about exercise for where that model does not generalise. Well, okay, so we need a model which have some degree of spatial invariance so we could have translation invariance.Okay, if we shift the digits slightly, the model's performance should not be, uh, affected drastically. So some amount of rotation should also be taken into account,right? And some amount of side invariants elimination invariants all these kinds of things should be taken into account. Okay, So I would just like you to just keep this in your mind. That what problem? Uh, what, uh, how would you solve this problem? What kind of architecture could you use?", 'start_time': '00:06:49', 'end_time': '00:09:52'}, {'Topic': 'Image Processing Challenges', 'transcript': "Okay.

So again, here is an example of dog from different, uh, angles. They're different sizes, different angles of the storey.so coming to some history of CNN's. So this problem has been quite well known. And since 1950 there's a lot of research going on. So one of the study done by Hubble and Weasel was, uh, they took a catand, uh, gave the card anaesthesia, so they forcefully kept the eyes opened up the card in the separatist, as you can see here.and they flashed a stimulus in front of cat's eyes. And in turn, they measure the electrical impulse generated in the brain in the brain of the cat. So they put electrodes in the brain. And whenever they would show some stimulus, there would be some neurons that would get excited, and they recorded that electric impulse.So what they did was, uh, showed some edges, uh, to the cat, some edges of various orientation, somewhere moving so you could see this board. This man is flashing this boat in front of the cat's eyes and in turn, they are recording the impulse in the cat's brain.Okay, so this was the experiment done by them, uh, human and basil. And the key findings were that, uh, there are some cells which get activated, uh, by some small edges or moving edges.Okay. And some cells are often direction specific. They only get excited when some edges being shown to them, Huh? Which is sliding from a particular direction onlyand, uh, there are higher higher level of cells, uh, more complex cells, which are selected with the length of the moving edge. So these kinds of these features simply build up over each other. So this was the key findings from the experiment.Okay, So that, uh, without losing the spatial invariance, how could we without flattening them? And how could we use that? So they figured out that somehow you need to build some hierarchy into the model to preserve the spatial information.", 'start_time': '00:09:52', 'end_time': '00:12:27'}, {'Topic': 'Historical Context of CNNs', 'transcript': "Okay, So these experiments basically set the stage for, uh, some outstanding research for the next 20 years and building on these ideas in 1986.

It was an unsurprised, uh, machine learning based architecture, which used to which was used to, uh, recognise digits.And it was the state of the art at its time. But some people said that due to, uh, computational limitations, they were not able to take it to the next close. Okay. And in the 19 nineties, building on these ideas, uh, so he was able to create first successful, uh, conclusion neural network. And it was called Lane at five.

And I want you all to think that how would you use this information To modify the existing neural network, which you have trained and administrators, uh, so that it is more robust to spatial invariance. Like how we approach this problem? Just think for a moment.Okay, So the solution would be to just stand for digits. Okay, so let's say, uh, this isn't modified image image, so I have just shrink the zero and, uh, introduced some translation variance. So what I'm doing here is that I took a simple MLP.You can call it, uh, zero director for now. It only detects if, uh, zero is present in some part of image or not. Okay, so, uh, what I'm doing here is I'm taking small part of the image and then flattening it. Okay,so, uh, let's say it has, uh, 2020 some 400 pixels here. Okay, Le, let's assume that this is a small part of this entire image and then flattening it and then putting it into one MLP. Okay, then I'm scanning across all this, uh, this entire image and looking for occurrence of zero.So what is the output of this? MLP would be, uh, probability distribution between 0 to, uh 1 which says that if it has detected zero or not. So if it thinks that the image which was cast into this MLP contains a zero, it will have a very high probability, otherwise very low probability.Okay, so I'm just scanning this entire image, using my MLP who look for the zero. Okay. So once I have scanned the entire image. And if I see if at any place there was a high output from a model, then I would say, Okay, I have found a zero. So in this way. So this is the idea that by scanning, we can, uh, actually, uh, use some kind of, uh, introduce some kind of special robustness. So, uh, relevant of this, uh, space where? Irrelevant of location.", 'start_time': '00:13:37', 'end_time': '00:16:06'}, {'Topic': 'Hyperparameters in CNNs', 'transcript': "In this image where the zero occurs by scanning, we are able to identify if it's present or not. Okay, so this was a key idea that so we will just take, uh, this idea forward and modified, and, uh, let's see how growth. Soone question there, uh, you were showing this. Oh, is that a kind of an or gate or kind of order of the outputs from here? What is, uh,yes? So basically, uh, I'm saying the highest of the highest for all these. Let's say this is, uh, the probability of finding a 00.10 0.01 and sometimes they'd say, Okay, I have very high probability of occurrence of zero. So I take the maximum of all these and then say Okay,I have found So zero Harris means means that I have found that the zero. Okay, so that's confusing. That, uhthat's good. So it was probably in the mind of the students, so I just thought I'd cheque. So it's a maximum that you're taking That takes the maximum. Yes.So this is where we have? Yeah, Yeah, for me. It's like 740. It's okay, but for seven, if we scan some part of seven and we could get one, right?Yeah, that's a valid problem. Uh, for that, uh, what we can do is we could we could add additional features. So that, uh, one so we can search for specific features, often digit digit. So let's say,uh, we could Instead of searching for the entire digit, we could search for some parts of it. So let's say if I have a feature like this, then maybe it's, uh indicates the presence of zero. Okay. And if I say that, Okay, there are four features which looks like this. They are coming in an image, so I can say, Okay, these are very close to zero, so you can just break that down into small features instead of taking into account the entire dignity.So what we're doing is we're hierarchically building this storey. So even another question that you should be asking at this point is that, uh, has chosen a box size that stores all of zero in it. Right? So also, he's shifting the scan that's taking place. He's shifting that, uh, square box in this exampleby a certain amount. Right. So if you are shifting by a certain amount, you might get part of the digit. Uh, and in fact, the square maybe too small to include the full digits. Right. So these are all questions that should be in your mind right now.

Uh, okay, So the idea here is that what has shown as a set of multi layer perceptron that are working on a small set of pixels in the neighbourhood,those are then being built upon by a second layer right, which is incorporating what are the features that have been seen in the previous player? So you're stacking up these features one on top of the other that are all essentially learning partial features to start with, and then more complete features, which then finally can lead to your classification. Does that make sense? The person who asked the questionwho asked the question. Yes. Okay, so this is just building on on what you know right now, which is a multi level perception, right?Yeah, go on. Sorry. Thank you. So, uh, mhm. So the idea here is that while scanning this entire image, the MLP is saying we are using the same MLB. We're not changing its weight, so this is very important. So this is called wait sharing him here. So we are sharing the weights. We're not introducing new weights at every, uh, box here,so which helps in reducing the A total number of parameters. We will study this, uh, detailing for the slides.So the key idea is that any any layer in MLP there's only one thing which is taking the weighted sum of inputs and applying a non linearity. So you must have you must be very familiar with this, uh, expression that output off any layer is basically a weighted sum of, uhuh, inputs to the input stood from previous layer and the weight. Right. So you're just basically Sundays and put some activation function. Might be sick model any any kind of non linearity. So in this scanning approach, we are also doing the same thing. We're just taking a small part of the bigger image using, uh, those inputs, flattening them out, multiplying them with some weights and just putting some activation over it.Okay, so So this is an example where I am building the hierarchy. So as Selves are just explained that we are building hierarchy. So here you can see that output of this, uh, from this box. So the first box in this cream colour. So this output would go here in the next,uh, and output from this second box, which is shifted slightly. It would be just a decent road here. So by doing this, you're just building a compact representation of this image here.Okay, So this is one level of hierarchy. You could add another level. So you're just building over these hierarchies. So you're just learning some small features. And then, uh, on those small features, you're learning some more complex features using their combination.", 'start_time': '00:18:58', 'end_time': '00:22:18'}, {'Topic': 'Weight Sharing and Parameter Reduction', 'transcript': "Okay, so you just, uh, scan. So these are the hair are different. New MLPs here. So this this MLP has, uh, one set of age. This is a new MLP. Here we are, scanning through it, okay. And then we have the final classification will happen. And so now we have sequentially added layers in one direction. We could also add, uh, complexity in the depth of it.So let's say you could have, uh, multiple different MLPs to scan on the first image itself. Earlier, I took an example of where MLP was detecting the zero.zero so you could have another MLP detects budget one another MLP for 32 for that kind of thing. And then you just basically build upon their features as well. So there is one head on. So you think. Think of this as a cube.right. And so, finally, you just can't get it. All of the features and you have a final classification.So this is how the idea of hair are key is taken into account from that horrible and visual experiment that we just build upon small features of the offer input and use those to classify, uh, actual image.Okay, so that's that's great. Let's just make sure that everybody is following this. Right. So, uh, guys, what? What do you think? Here are some of the hyper parameters.in what has been discussed up until now. What do you think are the hyper parameters? Remember, the hyper parametersare defined when we, uh, you know, kind of, uh, they're not the model parameters. The weights that are connecting one layer input layer into the next hidden layer we're talking about hyper parameters is the definition ofthe architecture and other parameters that define that architecture. Right? So, for example, in linear regression", 'start_time': '00:22:19', 'end_time': '00:24:35'}, {'Topic': 'Advanced Concepts in CNNs', 'transcript': "where we are using, uh, you know, say some regularisation. The regularisation constant is a hyper parameter, and the step size is a hyper parameter, right? We're still going to use gradient descent to learn the weights,but we, uh are defining. Uh, you know, uh, some other aspects of the network, right? So clearly step sizes. One hyper parameter here in a multilayered perceptron. What are the hyper parameters? It's the number of hidden nodes.and the number of hidden layers, right? Those are important hyper parameters. So what do you think are the hyper parameters here?maybe the ship. The shift. Science. Okay, so one of them is the shift size. That's good. what else? sorry.Philtre sides. So by philtre you're referring to the size of the square that we are shifting. Right, So good. Okay.What else? Number of philtres. Number of Philtres, Okay. a number of hidden layers. So what are we showing here? What is this,uh, diagram showing you each of these layers that you're seeing here? Uh, you know, so that we've got this image, the input image,right? And from each of the input images where we are creating one of these blue, uh, kind of compact representations, each of those blue compact representations aredifferent Philtres, right? So, as as government said in in one set of Philtres, you may be looking for horizontal lines in others, you may be looking at vertical lines, others you might be looking at, you know, uh,lines that are, in some way curved. Right? So you're looking for all of these different types of features. So when we talk about philtres, another way of thinking of these philtres these philtres comes from image processing,right where humans used to handcraft these philtres to extract features like edges and so on. Think of them as features that are being extracted, right? And so what you're now saying is you're getting this smaller sized image, which is the compaction. And then, as government has drawn these lines across these, uh, compact representations you're saying There are different features that are extracted from the same set of small number of.all located pixels, right? So philtre is nothing other than an M by N box right that defines which philtres are which pixels are connected to each other.in that MLP. So earlier, the multi layer Perceptron be flattened out the whole image. Now we only flattening out a small piece, which is this m by N box, which we're calling peopleright? And that's getting flattened and it can have a multilayered perceptron that finally gives an output. Now we're actually using a very simple multi layer perceptron here.which is essentially just got an input and an output layer. The output layers out, putting, like you said,a non linear transformation of the weighted sum of the parts. But remember that we are looking for the same feature with this, uh, N box, right? And so as we scan across, we are not needing to change the way. It's because the weights define which feature we're extracting, whether it's a vertical line or a horizontal line at the simplest right, so we don't need to change the weights, and that's why we're doing we're sharing.", 'start_time': '00:24:36', 'end_time': '00:29:00'}, {'Topic': 'Convolution vs Cross-Correlation', 'transcript': "okay. And then, similarly from the same set of pixels, we may want to have another feature extracted. So we are now got a new set of features and we're extracting that. The other thing to remember is right now is only talking about black and white image grayscale image.If we had a colour image, then we would actually the spirit er would not be an M by N. box. It would actually be a three dimensional box right where the third dimensionis three. So it's a M by n by three or the image that is a colour image which has got the red, green and blue.channels. right. So one way of visualising this you've got an image of some size. You are reducing the size of the image by doing the scanningright. And with every feature that you're creating is like another channel. Right? So we went from RGB Channel to another description of the same data which has a smaller X and Y axis as such of the image. But it has a depth to it, which is the number of features that have been extracted. Right. And this is a very common feature that you will see when you book shows you the more complicated structures of a CNN.You'll find that you start off with a large image with three channels and you end up with very small images, but with lots of features, lots of channels with it.Right. So this is a very, very important thing to remember when you're doing CNN's, because later on, you will see some very interesting uses of the same philtre to reduce dimensionality.", 'start_time': '00:29:01', 'end_time': '00:31:01'}, {'Topic': 'Pooling Techniques', 'transcript': "Okay, so do you understand all of these concepts? the shift size. you can see that the boxes are overlapping over each other, right? And so you can have a shiftof one pixel or two pixels or whatever. So that becomes a hyper parameter. Like you said, the philtre size definitely the size of the box, the number of philtres at each layer that you're definingright, and the number of such hidden layers that are transforming the input into a smaller, more compact representation.Right is another type of parameters. So very good. And what is the shift called? What is the technical term for shift?stride. Okay, great. Excellent. Okay. Good luck. Any questions on this before it goes on? Because things will only get more complex as we go on.Okay, Wonderful. Okay, So this is the example of, uh, typical Syrian architecture. This is called the Leonard five, which was developed by young liquid.Okay, so here we can see that, uh, this is, uh, example of the box. We were talking earlier. And by scanning this, uh, moving this box across this image. So we end up with several feature maps, you can see.So let's, uh let's start moving towards, uh, terminology. So these are called the future maps here. Okay. And so let's say we have six philtres of such types. This is one philtre, so if you have six philtresThen you will have six feature maps for each philtre because one feature because one philtre will scan the entire image.So we'll have one future map similarly for six philtre six philtres. You have six feature maps. Okay. And then there is a layer called sub sampling. So where you just, uh, take the max? Uh, just sample down. So, uh, one of the most common, uh, sub sampling technique is called Max pooling. So what they do here is they take two by two, sample out of this feature map and say this has value one. This is 263, and this is forso they take the maximum out of it and say so. This, uh, two by two matrix has four as the maximum value. So for the next, uh, through the next feature map, the four will be representing one pixel here instead of four pixels.Okay, So this is basically how we sub samples. So we are just if it has 2828 dimensions, then the output will have 14 by 14 dimensions by using this, uh, two by two Max schooling.Okay, so this is called sub sampling, and then we have another conclusion. Blog, another sub sampling layer, and then we have a fully connected layer. So this is the layer which actually does the classification into 10 outputs for administrator. They will pretend for any other data. There would be different number of classes Where, uh, where we want to classify our input image to be.uh, is this clear? So we will understand all these terms, uh, in the next slaves. So this is the typical architecture.

Thank you.okay? Okay, So there was one thing I want to visualise here. Yeah, so? So this is a typical grayscale image. So this is the original image you can see here. And this is just a zoom in version, so you can see that every pixel has a value from 0 to 2. 56 to 55. Sorry.So you can see, uh, the white pixel here it has value of 2. 55.

And so you can see here that while working with the edges here so there won't be three values available.Right? So that's why the right image is padded with black border. That's all zeros it contains okay? So, uh, the key idea here is that these features these these philtres basically give rise to different feature maps.

So the idea to understand here is that we can have different types of these features. Sorry. Philtres there is called right, Sobel.So you can say it's kind. It's, uh, edges. It will. This is the right Sobel philtre. You can see the values are changing. So there is a left Sobel which detects different orientation of hedges.

If I apply right Sobel, it detects vertical edges so on and so forth.is this clear? Yes, sir. Okay. so these weights are okay, So, uh, which no one is asking a question here. Uh, how? Well, normalising the pixel values affect the neural network.Um, so we should make sure you don't send it privately because those questions come to me, Uh, is not able to see it, but I've explained this, right? So when you talk about normalising the pixel values, what are you referring to? What you're talking about theapplication of these philtres. a new a new mutants piece. so, like dividing each pixel value by 2. 55.Okay, so that is really bringing the scale down to become from 0 to 1, right? Is that what you're? Okay, So what you're saying is, how does the normalisation of pixel values affect the neural network?a good book. Do you want to take this socialite? Uh, so please go ahead. Okay. So essentially, visual, what happens with the neural network when your input layer, uh, is essentially got very differing skills, right for each of the teachers. Then what is happening to the cost function that you're trying to minimise this that is stretched in certain directions and squeezed in other directions.Right. So whenever you actually calculate the gradient, you start kind of bouncing between points and don't move necessarily in the direction that gives you the, uh, which leads you directly to the ideal, uh, solution. Right? So what happens when you scale or normalise the numbers, All of the skills of all of the inputs? What ends up happening is that you get a much more rounder shift,uh, cost function, and so you will actually start to now the first known more directly towards the minimum,so it speeds up the minimisation of the past. That's the advantage of doing this normalisation okay? right. Anybody else have any questions around the application of the philtres themselves?are you making the Connexion between the fact that these philtres that are being played with up here, the colonel's as they're being referred to here, are essentially handcrafted Wales. Right? So you only have seven or eight philtres here.that are shown where the minus 101 minus 20 to minus 101 is one set of weights that have been handcrafted.Now, if you think about what a multilayered Perceptron is doing, it's actually learning these. It's learning these weights,right? So rather than us having to humanly created this, um, these philtres that we then know what kind of feature is going to be extracted by them by each application of the philtre throughout the image. What we are saying is we can actually now with neural networks, learn the weights, which will extract features that humans may not be able to interpret.but the neural network finds them useful. because they have been able to minimise the cost function as it is.does that make sense? so we are automatically extracting features that humans may not understand. right through each of these applications. Where the waves that you're seeing here, the minus 101 minus zero minus 101 are waves that are being set by the neural network automatically.right. And so we are learning these philtres.

So after, uh, sliding this philtre on the original image we get this is everything in This is the output of the free to map. This is the sharpen philtre. This is the blur philtre. And this is an edge detector.Okay, so now, uh, there's another term which is called convolution, so it is very similar to, uh cross cross correlation. But the key idea here is that while doing these calculations, your future map will be rotated by one or two degrees.Okay. Uh, so there is a visual example here, so So let's say this is your fault.

For those of you who don't know about padding, just don't worry about it. Just tell us what is going to be the size of the image that comes out on the other side when we do the scanning. Now the stride works left to rightand talk to bottom. right. So as you scan across, you're going one pixel at a time and going to the next position where the philtre is applied. And then when you get to the end, you shift the philtre down by one,uh, pixel and apply it again. Correct? Yes, sir. Okay. So what is going to be the size of the image that is coming out on the other end? Or the the two dimensional array that's coming out at the end?

Okay, here's another. Okay, Let's go. There is another question I want to ask you, okay?which is the number of computations you're doing. so floating point operations, floating point operations do you need to do here? But I believe that as an exercise for you, let's carry on.okay? Okay, So next, uh, was trying to visualise these features. So? So what we have here is so he worked with it was that we took an RGB image.and used 32 philtres to create 32 future maps. Okay, so what we're basically doing is we are just, uh, cross finding the cross correlation of each of this philtre with entire image. So as we, uh, looked earlier, uh, visual representation of cross correlation. So I just wanted to visualise that what these 32 philtres look like. Okay, SoI'm going to show you that how they look like, So I'm using really 16 for that. That's an architecture. It's a CNN architecture, very common.So it has taken, uh, RGB images of size 24 by 24. And so these are, uh this is the basic basic architecture. So it has to conclusion blockseach using 64 philtres. It then has a max full, then to conclusion blocks of 128. uh, philtres each again for school and then three conclusions by, uh, containing 2. 56 philtres and so on. You can see here and then we have a fully connected layer. Uh, the final layer, which classifies each imagine 2000 categories.This is the basic architecture of this video. 16. So, what we're trying to do here that in each conclusion lock so you can see there are 60 for future maps. We will just see how the 16th of future maps look like.So there are 1 28 ft high maps. We will look at each of them. Okay. So for the sake of convenience, I am only displaying features for these four or five players. The first, the very first conclusion there. The fourth player. 7, 1114. Okay, so let's just have a look at them.So this is, uh, first, uh, output of the conclusion block. Okay, so in what is this image of a house? Okay. And, uh, there are three, philtres of this dimension three by three by three.right. So after, uh, cross correlation of one philtre with the entire image, we get one feature map like this.Okay. For 60 for Philtres, 50 for such 60. For such philtres, we have 64 future maps, so you can see that each of the philtre is, uh,trying to highlight some specific features. So if you see here, this philtre is highlighting grass here.uh, this philtre here is highlighting the pillars. Or you could say the vertical edges. Okay. And, uhthis philtre here is highlighting the door so you can see each philtre is, uh, targeting some features.All right, so next I'm moving on to the fourth layer. So this was the layer of confusion blocks having 128 philtres.Okay, so I'm not showing all of the 128 philtres just because it gets very messy. So these are just 60 for philtres out of this 1. 28 here. So you can see, uh, compared from this is compared from the first congressional put, this one has become a little bit more detailed or abstract. You could say there is a lot more detail. There is a lot more textual information here.Some, uh, very dark. Some are highlighting several features. Okay, this is the fourth layer next, moving on to the seventh layer so you can see, uh, things are getting more abstract here. It's difficult to describe what features. Uh, CNN is learning,but we can see that something different is happening with each feature map. So there is a definition of house here, but in here, we have totally lost it. Maybe this this philtre would was looking for something else. which is not present in this feature in this image,maybe something like that. Okay, so now we have reached 11th layer. It has, I think, 2. 56 philtres and I'm displaying only 64 corresponding feature maps out of these two physics. Okay, No, things have become more abstract. And then, you know, 15th layer,uh, things become even more abstract. You could see that that some freedom maps are, uh, not saying anything at all. For example, there's there's only slight activation here, but for some philtres, there are a lot of evacuations happening.and in 17 player. So this has, uh, 512 feature maps and displaying only 64. You could see that only some some part of theafter the conclusion. Output has some information in it. Rest everything is just shut down. Okay, so let me just go through that again. So this is the first congressional put second. So ifeverybody realising that each of these small images is one layer now in that output right in this, so I shouldn't say one layer one feature, right? So one channel within the fourth layer. So everybody using, uh, you know, onepretty good right to generate each of these small images here, Right? And we're seeing What is it that it is learning from this image? And of course, this is the house. And, like, uh, was saying the V G architecture has been developed to learn 1000 different classes, right? So for different classes of images, you'll have different features, uh, getting highlighted right. And as we go throughright now, we are identifying edges and some relationships between those edges. But we're basically as we go, deeper and deeper,it actually becomes much more abstract, but is useful finally to make a classification that this is a house as opposed to an elephantright. Okay. Carry on group. Yeah. So this was the output of first conclusion block. 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th. And finally, we could use this output for classification. So basically, what we have done here is that we took an image and we extracted features out of that,and to some to that extent, that we are able to build a classified over it. That when we have an image of in house, we could say some features get activated if we have, uh, image of human that several different features get activated, and then we can use these activations to basically just classify or input dimension.Right. So here have how blood cells are. Okay, So the first output you could see here is that, uh, several feature maps are looking at the skin. Some are looking at beard. Some are looking at this the turbo and some are looking at the edges. So this is this little These feature maps would work for any human rights.On the second conclusion output, you could see things become more abstract. Then in third National Boardfort, you can see that this, uh, these features around here, they somehow represent I guess that human face that eyes and mouth Maybe that's my guess. I'm not sure.And again, in the just the final conclusion block things become very extracted. Only few future master activity dressed are just shut down.So here we have, uh, to human faces in the image so you could see in the final layer. So I'm showing, uh, all the 512 accusations here in the final conclusion block. So you could see, uh, things which are highlighted here in yellow.So similar features have been activated here. If you take a look at these two, these two here, and these two here, they look pretty similar.So we expect that any human, uh, face would excite these, uh, future maps of this, uh, Jeanette. And then later we can use this information, uh, to just classify that which category an image belongs to.Remember that the objective here is not to discriminate and identify between Luke and myself. Here. This is actually just to classify it into, uh, face versus house.Yes. So here we have a face versus house, so you can see that, uh, these are the features activated and different set of features activated in the final constitution outputso you can see they are not in this In this area, these we can have some not activity. any questions on this.Okay, Uh, we are at the end of the lecture, so I think Is this a good place to stop? Yes. Great. Excellent. Okay. So thank you so much for this. I think that's been wonderful. Uh, folks, uh, carry on with CNN's in on Saturday, so if there are no questions now, we'll end this session.Okay. No questions. So I'm ending the session. Thank you. Thanks, everyone.

CNNs utilize convolutional layers to detect features, pooling layers to reduce dimensionality, and activation functions to introduce non-linearity. The conversation highlights various applications of CNNs, including insect and disease detection, natural language processing (NLP), and their role in enhancing robustness against spatial variations in images. Historical context is provided, mentioning key developments such as the neo-cabinet architecture and LeNet-5. The importance of feature extraction, weight sharing, and the impact of hyperparameters on CNN performance is discussed. The session covers mathematical concepts related to convolution, cross-correlation, and the effects of stride and padding. The calculation of parameters in CNN layers is emphasized, illustrating how to determine the number of parameters based on filter size and input channels. The significance of biases in models and the dimensionality of feature maps is also addressed. The lecture concludes with an explanation of feature activation for classification tasks, using examples from CNN architectures like VGG, and emphasizes the progressive extraction of abstract features from images.', 'pinecone': True}
